product	my bichons think they are just ok  and they break easily when they really want food  not really a chew product at all 
health	i have a dog that is allergic to milk  flax  barley and kelp  these complete and natural allergy pill pockets were not allergy friendly for this dog  had i known the ingredients  i would not have bought them 
health	my dog loved both these and the peanut butter bones  but the bacon ones come out near whole and give him diarrhea  i thought it was due to him not chewing things up but turns out other dogs are not digesting these right  he never had trouble with the peanut butter  just the bacon  i feel lucky that he was able to pass them and did not suffer serious damage from these 
quality	it is just ok  the cats will occasionally bump it for treats  i bought it to try it out  i think it needs to be bigger and lighter  it kind of bobs when you push it  but it takes a lot of effort  my cats are extremely smart when they want to be  but also incredibly dumb sometimes too  do not get me wrong  i love them tons  they just are not phased by it  the picky one licks the strings  i do not know if they do not realize that it is edible or what  i have broken the string up to into smaller pieces and laid it in front of them  they do not touch it 
quality	my dog loves treats but will not even touch this  it was too hard for my german shepherd to chew and i do not know maybe   tasteless 
health	hard as rocks  could be a hazard  uneven coloration on the inside  have to use a serated knife to cut in half  for portioning  takes a lot of sawing motion   this is the first time i have experienced this with this product
product	these are hardly the   34 extra large  34  flakes advertised  it is certainly a bigger bag at 3 52 oz   but most of the flakes are on the smaller size with a fair amount of demolished looking ones packed into the bag  cat man doo bonito flakes are much  much larger than these 
product	i like the product but buying only two is disproportionately costly 
product	frontline is not an effective flea treatment  i do not know if the formulation has recently been changed  but the product no longer works to prevent fleas on dogs  it is an expensive item  and does not do what it promises to do  i will not purchase this item ever again  what a disappointment  if zero stars were an option  that is what i would choose 
quality	my puppies does not want to eat this jerky    got a weird smelled 
product	perfect size for my 6lb chihuahua only issue is that sometimes she can not retrieve what is inside and gets very frustrated 
health	my cat likes them  but you can get these for about  3 at pet shops and vet hospitals 
product	i love the kid invention story and my kid really wanted this to work  however  it is very unreliable  loses connectivity all the time  and simply does not work well  most annoying is that i bought a bunch of their cookies for this  and they fit very poorly into their own device  i am not sure why this is so complex with the sensor on the bottom  also  the blinking green  red  and orange lights are not very clear  nor is there decent support on their site <br  ><br  >here s the application  my daughter loves her dogs and wanted to visit with them from college and give them treats  by all measures  this should do that for her  and if they did it well  she would be ecstatic  sadly  she is now ever more heartbroken because we cannot get this to work  at all  best we have been able to do is get it to video every once and a while  i cannot recommend this product in its current incarnation    wait for a later 2 0 or better 3 0 version 
product	the description advertises 3 ingredients  but the package details 5 ingredients  including potassium sorbate and paprika extract 
health	we gave these to our dogs and they had diarrhea everywhere  then suspicious i stopped  and the diarrhea  weeks later i tentatively tried it as a treat again  instant diarrhea everywhere again 
product	i dunno   i have used this product before with great success   but this batch just did not do it  three months later  three treatments later and there are still fleas  cannot really recommend it   
quality	unfortunately  my jack russels do not like these  maybe they are spoiled with bully sticks 
quality	i actually ordered the predecessor to this food  i ordered the fancy feast appetizers but this product arrived instead <br  >my cats love fancy feast appetizers  but purina changed the formula and the name to purely fancy feast just this summer of 2015 <br  >my cats hate purely fancy feast  even the feral cats outside will not eat this stuff  it is a waste of money unless the store<br  >accepts returns 
health	we had a problem with the food we ordered from amazon  my dog has been eating this food for years and there was no problem  i decided to go for subscribing to avoid dragging 30 pounds of dog food from the store  once he started eating from the bag he started throwing up semi digested food  this went on for a week  he also began to refuse to eat the food unless i put something else in it  i called science diet and they filed a report  i stopped feeding this food and got locally purchased science diet  we are back to no problems  i wonder if there is something different about the food from amazon  maybe the way it is stored  no idea but we cancelled the subscription 
product	stupid toy   really a waste   unless your cat is a mountain lion   do not expect much effort in getting the treats out  absolute waste of money   get your cat a cardboard box   much more effective 
product	i ordered fuschia and was sent black  the product sent had a price sticker on it that was substantially less than what i paid  which i thought odd  as for how his works  i would have been better off saving my money and throwing the treats by hand  device jams and is clumsy which makes it pointless 
quality	our cat does not like this  we should have bought a small package before buying such a large bag 
health	it is not that i really do not like these  they were recommended by my groomer to help my dog s health thru his chemo treatments  it seemed they made him sick  so i am not sure if it is the chemo or    
quality	i have 3 yorkies ranging from standard to teacup  this dog food is the worst i have ever given the dogs  it goes in one end  and right out the other end  my patio never looked or smelled so bad  love the regular small bite  do not fix what is not broken 
quality	my spoiled dog would not eat it so i gave it to a friend  
health	not the best flavor if your dog has a sensitive stomach
quality	arrived in little crumble pieces  the pieces appear to fall apart easily  my dog did not care for them either  will not buy again 
product	gave my puppy 3 biscuits and she is been puking all afternoon since  requesting a refund and will not buy these again 
health	we had just opened the box yesterday and i noticed that the greenies were not looking as green as the greenies that i purchase from petco  i found it a bit strange  but my dog seemed to enjoy it  over night  my dog started acting strange and she threw up in the middle of the night after eating it  she has never thrown up from eating greenies before  i will not be purchasing from this vendor anymore  if you want your dog to live longer  please do not buy it from this place either  the greenies are a fake  it is a complete fraud from the real greenies sold at pet stores  buy it from petco instead  where you know that they are not fooling you 
product	overall these are great for my kittens  they enjoy them  sadly the last package i received were much harder than the last time i got these  they are not expired but are definitely different  i am not sure what the difference is between the two different packages  my kittens preferred the softer version  yet i cannot find the difference 
quality	i have been ordering this food  labeled   34 healthy support diet with dha  omega 3 and probiotics  34  for ages and my rabbit loved it  however  my most recent order  august 2015  was delivered as   34 healthy support diet with fortified pieces for dental health  omega 3 and probiotics  34  and my rabbit hates it  when i put it in her dish today she ran up all excited as usual  but then she sniffed it and refused to eat  it has weird blue worm shaped pieces in it now  i really cannot blame her for refusing to eat it  the item s description should be updated to reflect this change in the product  whatever this   34 dental health  34  ingredient is  it is not good  i am going to have to buy this product from the pet store now to avoid having the dental health product shipped to me 
quality	my cats have absolutely no interest in it  i gave it to my ex husband for his cats 
quality	our 15 lbs dogs did not care for this chew  they are very good at sharing their feelings about this 
product	received with many crushed broken   will not purchase again  dogs did like the product  used powdered biscuits in their food 
product	delivery was on time  the item was as described  however the amount of chicken wrapped around the rawhide stick was minimal on most of the 50 pieces  disappointing 
health	do not buy    no added benefit  my cats vomited   i feed them lifes abundance cat food   would not feed them anything else 
product	bag was opened upon receipt  this item is not eligible for return or replacement 
quality	our dogs would not eat them  nor would any other dogs i tried to give them to  smelled like chemicals 
health	my dogs got sick on them  sorry pedigree  you ususally make a very good product 
product	my cats were not really excited about these treats  unfortunately  they will eat them if they run out of kibble in their bowl 
quality	i liked the previous happy hips  i realize people do not want food items from china  but why cannot you make strips instead of mixed up duck  i know i do not want my jerky in this form  my dog does not like mixed things but will eat it  little by little my dog is losing things he really likes to things that are supposed to be   34 better  34  for him 
health	i do not know how this stuff is considered even edible for dogs  included in the ingredients are artificial flavors and products  and my dog got really sick within hours  stick with real food      34 peanut butter flavor  34  with zero peanut butter in it   
health	our vet recommended this food when we got our dog as a puppy  being a reputable brand and a decent price we started on pro plan puppy and kept her on pro plan for 2 years  after buying a new bag our dog was puking every day and eventually we racked up  1000 of vet bills once she got gastroenteritis and was pooping blood  we kept her on a bland diet and every time we would switch her back to the pro plan the vomiting returned  we even tried a new bag of pro plan thinking maybe we got a bad one  after 3 months of vet appointments and bland diets we finally switched dog food brands and have not had a problem since  not sure what changed with the formula here but it obviously was not for our dog 
product	i mistakenly bought this because it was labeled dental chew and the last order i bought which was also a dental chew  but was made in the us  when i received the treats i saw they were made in china  i wanted to return them  but found they were ineligible for return  i have never encountered this from amazon  but the policy stated i should have checked the return policy on the item before i bought it

quality	its not that i do not like it    my dog doesn t  he is never liked fruit so thought i would try them  no way  they smell great  dogs across street love them 
health	my eight week old puppy chews them down to nothingness within 20 minutes  it is not a challenge for the dog and is more of a choking hazard 
health	these gave my dog diarrhea  so much for using them as potty training treats  i had greasy poops all over my house for a week  i only gave her one at a time  so that is not it 
health	we purchased this thinking it would be good for diabetic cat who gets a midday snack and likes to nibble  it increased his blood sugar by over 200 points  it contains lots of corn  rice  wheat gluten  brewer s rice  chicken fat  although this product says   34 light   34  there are entirely too many grains  carbohydrates  in this product  it is not good for cats who have higher protein lower carb needs  i was shocked and dismayed royal canin would sell this product labeled as   34 light   34 
quality	very picky cat  unfortunately would not eat    <br  ><br  >i cannot say that there was anything wrong with the food because she likes the same brand just a different   34 flavor  34  
health	cats got very sick after eating these  we tried it twice a couple days apart to make sure they were the cause
product	these treats are not what i expected  they are a weird  solid block of gelatinous chicken goo that my cat wanted nothing to do with  the simply nourish brand is generally great  and my cat goes nuts for their dried shrimp treats  so i assumed this would be dried chicken bits  i would say we were both surprised and disappointed by this  honestly 
health	our dog loves them  but  she broke a tooth on one  do not think it is a flaw in your product  but  dog owner caution might be advised 
product	the product is at best  only somewhat effective  on my small dogs  the product reduced the flea population  my dogs are active and enjoy going outdoors  maybe this has something to do with it  i was concerned about the shelf life of the product because the packaging of my item seemed old and yellowed as if it had been on the shelf too long  i called the product support line and shared the lot number  i found out that the product  by use of the lot    that i received was 3 years and 3 months old but the service agent said not to worry this product has a 10 year shelf life  i was not convinced and made that clear but i ultimately accepted her response  no course of action was offered by the agent  now  i find the product is basically ineffective  buyers beware   i will not buy this product again 
health	my two small breed dogs love every thing pro plan  the canned food the dry food and the chicken snacks have made my dogs happy little girls  i break the chicken snacks in very small pieces and they go crazy over them  i only allow them one a day or they would google them down  i decided to try the lamb and was looking forward to their reaction to another pro plan delight  well for what ever reason they both showed no interest in the treats but after awhile did eat half of one  the oldest of the two got sick to her stomach and the other little one just would not eat any more  i have been so pleased with every pro plan item that this really surprised me  back to the chicken strips<br  >i am sure this was just a personal dislike not a bad product 
product	i have purchased these plato duck   34 thinkers  34  several times before from the all natural pet store and they were high quality  they snap in half and the expiration date was over a year and a half out from the date of purchase and my dog loved them  but when i purchased these on amazon  because they were slightly less expensive   the expiration date was merely 3 months out and the treats were very greasy and they did not snap in half  instead  they felt unnaturally elastic and simply bent without snapping  in short  they felt gross and unnatural  due to the extreme difference in quality between my prior in store purchases and this amazon purchase  i will not be giving these to my dog and i will contact the company for a full refund or replacement  plato should not be selling treats that are so close to the expiration date  particularly when the quality of the treats diminishes so significantly as the expiration date approaches 
product	while this product was very easy to put together  the price was great  i was really disappointed with the flooring  even before my puppy tried it out the mesh sagged  when she walked in the mesh went completely to the ground  she will not even get into the house now  good thing i did not spend that much on it     
health	we ordered this food to help our 17 year old kidney diseased cat because it is lower in phosphorus than other canned foods  and was at a price point we could afford  we were switching from dry food  our cat seemed to enjoy it at first  but the second or third day would barely eat any  finally  he had a catastrophic failure    vomited violently the contents of his stomach for the past 24 hours while trying to use the litter box  then came upstairs and pooped on the carpet  then peed everywhere  and then back to the litter box where he had a large movement  we could not get a vet to see him right away  which probably saved his life  as one suggested it sounded really bad and we should consider putting him down  we switched him to friskies classic pate  and added a bit of pumpkin to the food  he had perked up and been able to keep the food down and have normal results in the litterbox  now i have 21 cans of this food that i will not feed to him 
product	i was very disappointed in this product as you have to wash it and it does not really work until 3weeks of wear    that is crazy  too much for this product for that to not work right away   
product	it did not really make a difference with my crazy dog  when it thunders  she is literally climbing the walls
product	1 out of 2 cats liked the treats  normal for these two  liking the same food has become rare  they are light as a feather and smell like fish  the bag was barely halfway full which was disappointing  considering the price 
health	my dogs suffer from allergies and autoimmune issues so the vet has them on a grain free diet  initially ordered these as they are grain free  made in the u s a  and were fairly cheap for 3 bags  these were supposed to be soft and chewy but they were super hard  i do not know if they were old or the advertising on the product is off  i did not even bother to open them  i just sent them back  also these are grain free and the first ingredient is fish but they have a lot of harmful preservatives  do some research  there are better treat options on here 
quality	i purchased this brand of alfalfa for my pet bunnies  i have always ordered the oxbow brand in the past  i tried this brand because of the cheaper price and i quickly realized why it costs less  i purchased 4 bags in my order and regret doing so  two of the bags that i have opened are 90  stiff dry twigs that my bunnies will not eat  the other 10   is dust that they actually eat  the oxbow brand has some twigs in it  however they are smaller and not so stiff  there was never any leftover with the oxbow brand 
health	these treats made my cat sick  she was vomiting everywhere and gave her diarreah  i stopped giving them to her for a couple days just to make sure and then gave her a couple again and 40 mi ute s later she was vomiting again  i just threw them away because the made my fur baby sick 
quality	these were completely dried out and appeared to be old  we have bought this product before which resulted in very happy dogs but this shipment was a complete disappointment 
quality	it does not look very appetizing and my dogs do not like it 
health	my dogs have not eaten 1 yet  they just keeps hiding them  these do not smell 100  natural  revised  both dogs chewed on these  maybe consuming half an eat each  both dogs now have horrible diarrhea  never again 
product	the dog biscuits that arrived were old and rancid  when you opened the package you could smell the rancid oil in the product  additionally  the price was very expensive  i will certainly never buy these biscuits through this source again  i have purchased blue dog biscuits previously that were at least half the price and fresh 
quality	i do not know what is wrong with these treats  but my terrier will not eat them  he is diabetic and on such a strict diet  no fat due to pancrestitis and no sugar  so usually he is anxious to get anything for a treat  he turned his nose up and did not eat the 3 i put out for in 4 days 
health	it was okay i guess  it helped my cat with a skin irritation for like 10 minutes  does not do the job i was hoping for  would not buy again 
quality	treats were dried out  not moist  cats did not think much of them 
quality	i bought this to go with the shampoo i bought because they were out of the shampoo and conditioner with almond shea butter scent that i had purchased a year ago on tv  super bummed i cannot find that anymore  do not like this scent as well 
health	i like greenies products but the very first time i gave it too my cat he threw up for two days 
quality	my puppy wants to put everything in her mouth except these  lucky me  i bought two bags  i have tried to offer them to other dogs on we meet on the street  they do not like them either  weirdest damn thing i have ever seen my pup will gonfor her kibble over these  i have used them for trainjng  and they are awful becaise the dog hates them  i have hidden the zuke s in a   34 work for a treat  34  toy to mix up  it comes out and she keeps looking for her regular kibble  for better than kibble treats  i have had best luck with rocco and roxie jerky and lamb lung  those make her so happy  this stuff is not good for anything 
health	one of our cats experienced an allergic  skin reaction to this formula  as soon as we discontinued use  the skin irritation cleared up 
product	although the liter is lightweight as promised  it does not clump as well  nor does it absorb odors at all  i had to mix in a ton of baking soda just for a slight improvement in the smell  disappointed 
product	high price   smell was not right  my dogs turned away from it<br  >this is not made in usa<br  >will not buy again
product	the box arrived and it was packaged fine and it was completely sealed  however  i opened it up and the cans were dented and they were leaking all over the place  it was totally disgusting 
quality	the dogs love them but they stink  my whole cupboard smells like fish  i will not buy them again 
quality	my kitties were not enamored over this  they turned their noses up  fussy fur balls  they prefer other tiki cat products  tiki cat is a good cat food  but mine just did not like this particular one 
health	i have been buying these for my dogs for a while now  but the last 2 batches i have gotten have given my dogs diarrhea really bad  i do not know if something has changed with these  but i will not be buying more   
product	i do not really know how to rate this product  my cats seems to enjoy it a great deal  waking me up at 6am each morning so that i might feed it to them  but they also seem to enjoy licking their privates for hours on end as well 
quality	for some reason my cats just do not care for them
quality	i do not hate it  my cat hates it  i thought i would try something new  but there is something in it that she does not like 
quality	i ordered 3 of these due to the reviews  price and the fact i was going on a family vacation with 5 dogs and treats get expensive  i am sorry to say that none of the dogs liked these too much  pretty much turned their noses up except for buddy  who will eat anything  it is probably because they are accumstomed to chicken jerky  not from china   and handmade food  it is a shame  it seems like a good product but we just have picky pets 
quality	my cat with urinary issues who i was buying it for will not touch them  and he usually eats anything  neither will my other two cats 
product	this thing lasted 3 minutes with our lab pit mix  waste of money 
health	my 6 lb chihuahua that is on same natural diet   no table scraps    i add these greenies    he began to vomit yellow bio foam randomly      not safe for animals 
quality	my sun conure only eats about half of this  she does not like the colored processed pellets at all 
health	dogs liked them but there were some uh clear digestive issues
product	the bully sticks are great quality  that is true  but the description says there will be 12 and my sealed package only had 8            
product	i ordered these bully sticks and they arrived on time  but there was barely anything in the package  the photo shows a very packed bag of bully sticks  my bag looked only half full  brand new  i only really ended up with about 12 sticks  which puts the price per stick at about 2 50  this is still a lot cheaper than a pet store  but i expected a bit more based on the photo  that being said  the dog still loves them  which is why i am giving it 3 stars 
product	absolutely horrible nutritional facts  mostly fat and filler  do not buy  not healthy
health	the packaging of the savory salmon i received was written in spanish  i do not believe this particular batch was made to sell in the us  my kitten ate this  and has eaten other science diet flavors without issue  and began having diarrhea  i stopped serving this flavor and the problem cleared up 
product	very disappointed  cookies were not in whole prices  lots were crumbled  
health	gave my dog bad diarrhea  then she went lethargic need to see the vet right away  got a little better with fluid but got worse in few hours  got admitted to pet er for iv drip overnight  still recovering after 2 days 
product	although they claim to make most of their products in the usa  and there is nothing labeled on the packaging  these are imported from china  and therefore very suspect for feeding pets  i threw it away immediately 
quality	my ferrets did not like these treats and while ferrets are picky eaters  they did not eat one  some ferrets probably love them though   
quality	i love hill s science diet brand food  but this cat food would dry out and get crusty way too quickly  so much food was wasted because my cat refused to eat it once it dried out 
quality	my do does not like them they look and feel like cardboard and my dog will eat anything  he took one sniff and turned away and will not go to them at all  it was a waste of money
health	none of my cats liked this version of meow mix  and i feed 28 cats  ages 3 to 18 years old  they enjoy original blend as a treat  but would not touch hairball blend  the food was fresh   smelled fine to this human caretaker  guess my cats are extra finicky  gave the bag to a neighbor    his cats liked it 
health	we tried this but it did not help my puppy s ear infection  we ended up going to the vet and spending the money for the antibiotic antifungal that cleared it right up 
health	does not seem to really get rid of fleas  did not make anybody sick or give them diarhea as some products do  but great shipping and good price 
quality	this product is ok  but must be very careful on the dosage when adding to your pond  first time i used it lost 9 goldfish out of 12  i lowered the dosage yesterday and still lost my favorite koi fish  other fish appear ok  when using algae control  expect your fish to hide  not eat and appear gasping for air  this is a side effect of the chemical  takes about two days for fish to be back to normal  i have only used this product twice  maybe it takes awhile for fish to adjust to it  it is added once a week at least 3 days after you add micro lift to your pond weekly  be sure and use micro lift for your fish to keep them healthly  stress coat is also good when adding new fish or when adding water to your pond if on city water because of the chloride in the water  hope this has helped you pond owners 
quality	my dogd favorite treat  she will not eat them as all 5 bags were hard as rocks 
health	we bought several bags of these jerky treats for our dogs and they seem to love them  but        now my morkie has been diagnosed with liver disease and it may be attributed to these jerkey treats made in china <br  >they are not returnable or refundable <br  >our vet strongly advised that we stop giving these treats to both of our dogs <br  >if i were anyone thinking of giving these treats to your dogs  thank again and please ask your vet before wasting your money 
product	i received a bag of these puffed lamb lung treats in august 2015 and they were perfect  they looked like the views of the product on the description page and easily broke apart into smaller pieces  most of the pieces were flat and varied in thickness from 1 4 to 3 8 of an inch in thickness  see first 2 photos  i ordered and received another bag in november  gave it a quick look  didn t open the bag  and updated my review saying they were great  two weeks later when i opened the bag  i found the contents of this bag were completely different from the first bag and did not look like the product photos  the pieces were more like lumps up to an inch thick and almost impossible to break up by hand  also many were almost hand size    see photos 3  4  and 5  i contacted the seller and they immediately refunded my payment and told me to keep the product  saying they wanted me to be satisfied  i explained my problem with the new bag and the woman said they had no control over the product as it was a natural process  this second bag could not have been the result of the same process as the first  i would much rather have the product as shown in the product photos instead of my refund  if you buy these you will need a hammer to break them apart  so the seller gets a 5 star rating for their prompt refund and wanting the buyer to be happy  but the product gets a 1 star for not being as described pictured 
product	my italian greyhound is vegan  unless someone else gives him something  i do not mind    he eats v dog kibble plus whatever yummy thing i decide to mix in haha  like sweet potato  carrot  rice  nutritional yeast  coconut  peanut butter  peas  chickpeas etc    he loves all things coconut so i was really surprised that he did not like these  could not get him to eat one if i tried lol   also side note  the treats pictured look to be a dark brown  whereas the ones i got were almost pure white    maybe a bad batch or something 
health	they are chewy not dried apple rings  have to be in the room when my dog eats it because i am afraid she will choke on it  seems hard for her to chew  she is a 16 pounder so she has a little mouth  the banana chips are much better   
health	warning   pet owners if your dog has any allergies this product is not for you  i gave this to my dog and he got hives and lose patches of fur  it is made in canada  not the u s 
product	i order this item regularly  yet  i get a different variety of it every time i order  there seem to be two kinds they send  one is a completely  non see through pouch that is foil lined and the other has a clear   34 window  34  on the front of the package so you can see the product  i prefer the one that is not see through  it is a more palatable treat for my cat  the see through package zip lock top does not zip shut and it causes the treats to harden  making it harder for my cat to eat  the other non see through package has a different colored treat  cream colored  and the treats seem to stay fresher in the non see through package and the zip close top works better  the see through package is a brown colored treat  i use the automatic reorder option  but like i mentioned  i get a slightly different product each time i reorder  not sure why   
quality	both of our dogs did not care for this treat  it is weird because they both love the salmon filets from the same company 
product	a bit pricey and so far  my dogs rarely eat it after 4 days  i do like the stay fresh packaging  and hope my dogs adjust  this review may be updated later
product	used to love this treat but the last few shipments have literally been pulverized rather than chunks which is impossible to give  too expensive for powder 
quality	one of my pooches will not touch this treat and the other little guy    well  he eats anything  great idea  but i will not be purchasing this again  
health	i go through rawhide and bully sticks like wildfire  so i bought these because of the positive reviews and good pricing  after giving my 60lb lab mix about 5 or 6 of these over the course of a week  i have to say that i am very disappointed  diarrhea and flatulence abound  and he regularly consumes raw hide and other brands of bully sticks  1 every day or two  so it is not a question of a sensitive stomach or introducing something new to his diet <br  ><br  >i m also put off because these stink way worse than any other brand i have purchased  will not be buying again  and i will probably throw the rest away  what a waste   
health	our finicky cat likes these as a treat  so we are happy about that aspect of the purchase  as a hairball control  however  they are impractical since the recommendation is   34 12 treats all at once daily   34  at that rate  we would need multiple packages each week  too expensive 
health	no  they did not care for it although they ate it  then they got diarrhea 
quality	does not work  i have had it for months now and it seems some months my dog does not itch and some he does  and now during the height of summer it is totally ineffective  looks cute new as a necklace and the concept of a nontoxic flea solution is great but unfortunaltely it does not work  and within a month the necklace stretched out and it does not even look cute anymore there are missing ones and spaces in between  even as a decorative necklace it is no good  fail  sorry  edit  i contacted seller and they were quick and courteous  i told them my feelings on the collar and they refunded me my money  well appreciated and added stars for good customer service 
product	very disappointed  it arrived as dust  very difficult to use as a treat if it is all crumbled to nothing but chicken dust 
product	this stuff must be fake  does not seem to help at all  and it is damn expensive
quality	my cat did not like this at all  i had to stop putting it on his food because he would not eat the food 
product	i hate it    what a waste of money  the adjustable window for the treats does not stay where you put it   opens all the way 
product	way too expensive  competitors are coming in with better products and better price 
quality	i am not sure why my dogs do not care for this combination with chicken and sweet potato  i always like natural balance products 
health	made my ferret sick  switched her food and now she is doing much better 
quality	i do not want to say that i do not like this item because i think it is a great idea  i think the problem for me is my yorkshire terrier just does not get it  he will not attempt to get the treats even if i lift the tops a little  he would rather take the yellow tops and chew on them once he has eaten the treat  probably better for a bigger dog 
quality	my dogs would not eat the chicken strips so according to my dogs the product is not very good 
health	caused my dog to have digestive issues  stopped giving them to her 
product	my yorkie does not really like cookie treats like this  so i give it an average star 
quality	my cat liked the old fancy feast but does not like any of the purely products   i wish they would go back to the old flavor  even the stray hungry cats in neighborhood turn their nose up for this food and the stray dogs will not eat it  so something is wrong with it 
product	pros <br  > treats are good size for training<br  > dogs like them<br  ><br  >cons <br  >  bag is tiny<br  > expensive for size<br  > does not pass the squirrel test  dog was more interested in chasing squirrel than eating treat <br  > chickens had to die for your dog s pleasure
quality	i bought it because i thought it has lower calories than zuke s  but they are about the same  i got 4 bags and now my shepherd finally finished three  she always loves treats  any kind  but is not particularly excited about this one  what i do not like is that these treats are very hard   hard to digest as well i believe  i cannot even break it in half with my fingers 
product	picture makes you believe that it is 3 bully sticks but it is only one   what a rip off to pay  8 55 for just one stick  i would never have purchased if i had known it was only one stick   very deceptive 
quality	cat wanted nothing to do with it    too hard to eat and not wigley to play with 
health	recently bought these for my puppy after reading what i thought were pretty good reviews  after my experience  and after a little more research into this product and looking at all the reviews  the one star ones included   i am horrified and mad at myself that i even gave these to my puppy <br  ><br  >it seems like any dog treat these days is under fire   is it made in china  does it have antibiotics or any other chemicals  it seems like the only way to insure that your puppy has safe treats is to make the jerky yourself   which is expensive  time consuming  and not practical for most people <br  ><br  >my problem with these treats is that they are not hard enough to make your dog chew them and they are just soft enough to allow your dog to swallow them whole  most dogs inhale their food and do not even chew it  i gave one of these to my puppy  we went for a car ride later that evening and she gets car sick unfortunately  she vomited  which is not uncommon with a car ride  but i was shocked to see a 4 inch whole sweet potato in her vomit  i can only imagine what would have happened if she did not vomit and it was allowed to just sit there in her intestinal tract  if you are going to give these to your puppy  i would suggest cutting them into bite size pieces 
quality	these smell so bad and it does not go away  i cannot wash the smell off  more importantly my dog wont eat them  they are too hard for her to eat 
quality	until this dog treat changed to the   34 crunchy  34  recipe we loved this treat  it is just too hard to give to our dogs and if you want to break one in half for a smaller dog  it is nearly impossible  time to find a new treat 
product	my cat loves it  but the package service was really bad and two cans spilled all pate   
product	not made for puppies  these treats are very hard on cocker spaniel puppies systems  the pups love them but the side effects are not worth the side effects 
quality	the twist  n treat puppy toy is made of dense rubber and is about the same diameter as a racquetball  the two halves unscrew which can make it a little clumsy to fill with puppy kibble without dumping it all over the place when you put it back together  my puppy is only somewhat interested in it  perhaps because it is shaped more like a yo yo than a ball  a ball shaped toy will roll away from her when she hits at it giving her something to chase  this toy just kind of sit there and wobbles a bit  but not in a very exciting way  the rubber has a scent that  while not unpleasant  overpowers the scent of the food  i am not sure zoe sees the point of trying to get the kibble out <br  ><br  >the toy itself arrives exactly as pictured and seems to be very well made and durable  sadly  my dogs are just not interested 
health	product came fresh and the strips appear moist  however they made my dog have loose stools and i noticed no difference in terms of the supposed joint benefits
health	my cats vomited green puke everywhere several times immediately after having these treats 
quality	chewy items always seem to have a peculiar smell to them  my dog does not like these   i could smell why  i guess to each his her own 
product	i followed the instructions and ended up with fleas  i was really hoping for there to be a natural solution but was greatly disappointed  i would not recommend it to anyone 
health	my cats vomited green puke everywhere several times immediately after having these treats 
product	for some reason i have now used two treatments and my two dogs still have fleas i will never buy this again 70 bucks down the drain
quality	these are sort of a rip off to me  from what i can tell  and correct me if i am wrong  but it is the fact that they are hard and their shape that cleans your cats teeth  well  there are lots of hard cat treats out there  and many that my cat enjoys significantly more than these  he usually does not touch them  plus if your cat does not chew treats like mine sometimes doesn t  they do no good at all  it just seems like a gimmick to me  am i wrong 
product	cats love it  but i am annoyed the price keeps going up  a week ago  it was  2 less  2 mos ago  it was  3 less  it is not amazing quality  but my skinny older cat has gotten picky and she loves this  i am going through cans quickly and the price increase is making me think about switching again 
quality	i have a diabetic cat and love to feed him the turkey version  i see why these do not cost as much  they are large  hard squares  one of my cats will not touch them  and the other is a bit reluctant  if they were eligible for return i certainly would  to be fair to whole life  i do like the chicken and turkey versions  they are pricey  but good 
product	way to expensive  and has corn syrup  so probably not good for dogs with yeast condition  otherwise my brittany loves them  paid  6 99 for same thing today at petsmart 
product	only giving 3 stars as they have not helped my dog s breath but vet says with some breath issues treats will not work only antibiotics so maybe this is the case  dog does like them but are too expensive for me if wont help her breath 
health	these used to be my dog s favorite  but a bout of severe diarrhea resulted in a more sensitive stomach  so he can no longer have these  a real bummer  because they last  are nutritious  and provide hours of entertainment  keeping a curious pup out of trouble 
product	i did not realize when i ordered this to try on my dog s chronic yeasty ear that this is basically alcohol and gentian violet  i have short lived messy success with gentian violet on its own  which was more than i can say for this watered down product i paid too much for  i could have made this in double size for  2 using gentian violet and rubbing alcohol from walmart  there was no noticeable difference  the two stars are for fast shipping and the idea that this might work for a minor issue for some people 
quality	there are much better dog foods out there for less money  my boys love diamond naturals  i am very happy i tried it and they cannot eat it fast enough  i have a pekipom and a puggle
product	i have been buying these chews for years and my dogs love them <br  ><br  >on july 21st  2015 i placed an order for lit with duck meal for small to medium dogs  what i received was different from the product i had received in the past  in the past they were in fact   34 chews  34  that took my dogs several hours to finish  the chews i received from the july 21st order were brittle and broke apart easily in my hands  i emailed amazon with the issue and they offered to replace them for free <br  ><br  >i received the replacement order today  july 29th  and the replacement items were the same as the ones i had received early  brittle and easily broken <br  ><br  >both of these packages had a best by date of 11 13 2016 with the following lot numbers <br  >3142pd nt2 20 21 30<br  >5142pd nt2 20 05 59<br  ><br  >because of the first lot being bad i went and purchased a package locally which had a best by date of 5 6 2016 with a lot number of 4127pd<br  ><br  >i ve attached a photo of the bad chews on the left with the good chews on the right <br  ><br  >for the time being i would not buy from amazon and i would suggest amazon pull these packages with bad lot numbers 
health	a metal piece of the mechanism that keeps this open easily fell out into the treats i had inside  i easily could have fed it to my dog seriously harming her  it was not a defect in the product it was the design i would say this product is dangerous and recommend you go with something by a different manufacturer 
product	i would choose the boots and barkley brand over cadet  they barely have any chicken wrapped around them  target has run out of boots and barkley in my area  cadet is cheaper but not worth it unless they put more chicken around the twists  i would not buy these again 
health	made my puppy constipation   <br  >i usually give him the blue buffalo treats but wanted to try and add some other flavors and purchased these <br  ><br  >i gave them to my other dog  she can eat everything with no problem    
health	does not hold up to the kong name  gets soggy quickly   does not last more than a few hours before i take it away  concerned it might be a choking hazard  would not purchase again 
health	gave my dog severe diarrhea  and she only ate one of them  she has a strong stomach so i am thinking i got a bad batch 
product	the canes came in all bend to the point that we cannot use can opener  so i would say they are all damage 
quality	my doxies will not eat these treats  smell bad  look bad  just not a good product 
quality	my dogs absolutely hate these things  they love the canned food and the dry food  however  they will not go near these things at all  big disappointment 
quality	i have a sphynx kitty and this is what the breeder had him on so i gave it to him also  it is been about 2 weeks and i have already switched him  the main ingredient is grain  chicken by product meal  egg product  dried beef pulp    there is a handful of ingredients i can pronounce of which are not the best  his poo and farts really stink  this food is also high in fat  i gave it 2 stars because he liked it or seemed to  he ate the wet and dry food  <br  >for the price though i have switched to orijen and weruva for wet 
health	gave one a day for 4 days to our miniature schnauzer and he would chew for a few minutes but then swallow 1 2 of it whole so we researched to see the consequences of him doing this and found that the company changed the formula so it would dissolve due to dogs getting intestinal blockage with the old formula we figured it was safe but stopped giving them because it just did not seem like it would be good for his stomach    well he got very bad diarrhea for 4 days and every time we took him out he would try to eat tons of grass  we fed him rice and egg because we thought maybe he got a bug but then he did not poo for over 24 hours and took him to the vet  they did an ultrasound and saw a partial blockage in his intestine and kept him over night and did a repeat the next day and said it was very slowly moving down and sent him home  when he finally pooped it was giant chunks of half dissolved green pieces that were spongy and thick feeling  this could have turned out very bad and very expensive   <br  >never again will i buy my dog these types of   34 treats  34    
health	received this product  purina pro plan dry dog food  savor  shredded    6 23 15   immediately placed in my air tight containers for storage  today when i went to use i found some gnat like insects  upon closer inspection  i found the food was infested with larvae  eggs  webs and more of these insects  totally gross  i had to throw out the food and sterilize the containers  i am not certain how to notify amazon but what a disappointment  called the vet and he said the dogs should be ok  their systems are very strong considering what they sometimes eat when i am not around but i need to keep an eye on them just in case  anyways  i suggest everyone who ordered this product to check it immediately for any form of infestation  i will be wearing my glasses next time  i am not certain how to notify amazon and if i did would they be able to do anything about it  i guess it is live and learn and from now on it is back in the car and to the pet store so if it happens again i can take it back and speak to someone  maybe even get reimbursed  please check your packages closely once received so your not feeding your pets more than the food you paid for 
quality	we have a three month old purebred boston terrier  he loves chicken and turkey  he is on a mostly raw diet   but he will not touch these  just does not like them  spits them out  not a fan at all  however  i have found that he likes the salmon flavor <br  ><br  >if his tastes change when he gets older  i will update my review 
product	i purchased this product based on other customers reviews and one customer answer that this is 12 can purchase  however i received only 6 cans and every one was damaged  my dogs love this product  and i decided not to return it  but i will not recommend anyone to purchase it  price per can is outrageous  you can find much better deals somewhere else  do not purchase it 
health	dog liked but gave him yeast infection  i love honest kitchen grain free food though    
health	do not buy this formula  something is wrong with the bag that i received  i was feeding it to my kitten and the kitten vomited 3 times over two days  i stopped feeding it to the kitten and started giving it to stray cats outdoors  they vomited as well  i noticed vomit on my car and outside my house  <br  ><br  >don t buy this <br  ><br  >batch code 50631805 0931l09
product	this 1st bag i bought looked like this picture  good sized bits and easy to pull one out and give to the pups  they like them  they are crunchy  they have fun  the 2nd bag was clearly just the remains of some other bags  tiny annoying pieces  like the leftovers no one else wanted  i love this company and will buy again  but am def hoping for better 
quality	in theory  these should be great  i got two    one for each dog  my one dog likes to pick it up and carry it to the couch like any other chew toy  but then he loses interest  neither dog can figure out how to get the treats to come out  and they give up way too quickly  they prefer the long tubes that squeek  although they have become experts at getting the treats out of those  they just do not care for these 
quality	my yorkie did not like this food  he would not eat it  i switched him to taste of the wild which he loves and seems to be more nutritious 
health	my cat likes this food  but the ingredients leave a lot to be desired  manufacturer must put some special coating or additive that appeals to cats  yin is 17 5 years old and i bought this to see if she would eat more as she had lost weight  she is eating more and has more frequent and softer waste  i feel it is overpriced with all the fillers used  the main ingredients are rice and corn  i do not recommend this cat food  purina beyond is better 
health	unfortunately did not work  the flea problem in southern california seems to have gotten worse over the last 4 5 years  our dog is 10 years old now and we never had any flea problems in the first 5 years of having her  now fighting the fleas is almost a year round problem <br  >this time i used a capstar pill first  which does effectively knock down an infestation of fleas  but  it is not designed to keep fleas away so you must combine it with another long term approach  so i bought and tried sentry fiproguard max flea and it did not do anything to keep the fleas away  within 2 weeks of using sentry the fleas were back in full force and just having a field day on our dog <br  >i consulted our vet and he informed me that no topicals work any longer here in southern california and that the fleas have now evolved to be immune to their application  he gave me a prescription for comfortis pills which is given monthly  this  of course  is more expensive than over the counter flea treatments but i am running out of options  he assures me it will work    fingers crossed 
health	i have bought this food from this several times and have always been happy with my purchase but this last time the food looked different  a much bigger kibble  almost double the normal size  and both of my cats got sick right after giving them this food  i went to our local pet store and bought a bag of royal canin and it was what we were used to and my cats have been ok since  i will not purchase from this seller again 
health	these treats made both of my dogs severely ill  i had to rush them to emergency  ended up throwing them all in the trash 
health	these treats nearly killed my dog earlier this week  i had no idea they were dangerous until i started researching them on the internet after my dog suddenly became extremely ill this week  we thought he was going to die it was so bad  we spent 700 dollars at the vet dealing with an undigested greenie treat that gave him an upper gi bleed and a great deal of abdominal pain  we honestly thought he was going to die  if you love your dog like family  you need to research greenies before you end up with a very sick  or dead  dog 
quality	this was the good food   my dog loved it  when i was adding it to dry food that she would eat them both  but recently they started adding more water to it   looks like they wanted to save some money  also  my dog does not like it any more   maybe they changed some ingredient as well 
quality	usually buy different   34 taste  34  gave these a try and my dog  s  will not eat them  as far as a product though  no issues  they are rather large 
health	this has worked on my cats in the past  but i discovered that it nearly killed my older cat  i was ready to have him put down because he was failing so badly  then i read where these products are not safe for elderly cats and cause organ deterioration in them  i held out not putting my sweet 18 year old boy down  he has improved and doing better now that i quit using these products  my friend was not so lucky  her old cat died a terrible death  there should be cautions put on these products letting people who have old cats to be cautious in using these 
product	this was a scam  it clearly states that one ordwr is a 4 pack of 7lb bags  but i only received one 7lb bag per order 
health	my dog got sick  bloody stools and diarrhea  after eating this    had to spend more than 500 dollars to go through examinations and medications  i should not have bought this through amazon 
quality	i am at a loss  i started my golden retriever puppy on natural baland grain free lamb and rice  she is loved it for the past 1 5 years  never had anything else  now she will not touch it  will eat any other brand dog food but will not touch natural balance lamb  bison  or fowl  i do not know if they have changed something  or bad batch  but i have  170 worth of l brand new amazon purchased bags of large breed grain free n b  and my girl will not touch it 
quality	my dog did not care for it  there was more hard plastic than rubber and he could not really hold it in his mouth  he chased it but could not pick it up no matter how hard he tried  maybe another dog will like it 
quality	my dog would not eat them  she likes kiwi in her treats 
product	my golden retriever ate it in an hour  a waste of money as i thought they were tough   supposed to last 
product	the hinge broke the first time i used it  very cheap  very disappointed 
health	my pup live bully sticks  i specifically ordered these because they were made in usa  15 mins after chewing on the bully stick for 15 mins my dog vomited and kept drive heaving  food is almost always a ymmv product but i will admit that something smelled a little off on these bully sticks  i buy 12  34  bully sticks from a local boutique pet store and they are both thicker and smell a lot fresher  maybe it was the texas heat but i threw the rest out and will not be ordering again 
product	my dog eats them to fast  they are thin  do not feel or look like their usual bully snacks from costco or petco  i am not buying again  
quality	my macaw hates it     throws it on the floor  my dogs love it  so i do not like it for the bird  but like it for the dogs  double duty  thanks  will probably buy again    for the dogs 
health	these are ok but i think my labs eat them too quickly to be effective  they try to eat things as quickly as possible and will only chew just enough until they can swallow  i am afraid swallowing large chunks of these will cause digestive issues  if i give them these  it is not too often  i do not think the ingredients are good enough to be giving them one everyday as suggested on the package 
product	size info is lacking on this product  resulting in a return to amazon  this toy is high quality  but big and heavy  making it inappropriate for my small dogs  they are old  lack teeth  and could not manage to pick the toy up  the food storage area is disappointingly small and unsuitable for small dry treats  only the center can be filled  not the   34 legs   34  so you really have to use messy peanut butter to make the treats   34 stick   34  for these reasons it is back to the drawing board for me as i continue my search for the ideal treat dispensing dog toy 
product	i have used these for 7  years on my english springer spaniel  all of a sudden  they stopped working  i looked at the package and saw that the expiration date had past  after a visit to the vet  she put my dog on another flea tick med  poor dog was so miserable and scratchy  now she is fine again  i have unused doses of this med  let me know if you would like them back 
product	terrible  nothing like photo  all small seed and sunflower  way overpriced for quality
product	do not buy this  it is overpriced  i painstakingly believed it was 24 cans but is 12  no cat food is worth this much 
health	i give my cat 5 treats one time day after 4 5 hours he vomiting  try one time more and he vomiting again     
product	it is cheaper than the pet stores  but is still too expensive for us 
health	two friends seem to like it alot  but it made one of my dogs sick  the other dog did ok  but i will give the remaining product to the friend  i guess that dog just has a sensative digestive system  be careful and keep a close eye on your dog until you are sure they are ok taking it 
quality	i wish u could see my poor whipper sitting on the table  i feed him there since my back is too bad to do the floor  he is staring at me waiting 4 his ff appetizer he loves so much  i ordered it from amazon recently and it was the old stuff  when i looked at the page it seemed to be the old stuff then i found out that the   34 new  34  was whited out to fool us  now i have 20 inedible pkgs of cat food and my cat hates me  he thinks i am holding out on him  of course i feel terrible as i cannot explain it to him   he did not eat the   34 new  34  stuff and does not know what happened to his good stuff  saying this is better 4 health of cats is none of ur business  i feed my cats and vet my cats as i see fit  well they will not be fed with this horrible stuff  just looking at it is enuf to turn my stomach but i did give it a try to be fair  luckily i have plenty of raccoons who eat anything  i hope it does not kill them 
quality	too hard to chewy for my dog  do not like it 
quality	my problem with the product is that my tortoises do not eat it  i keep a bowl of the pellets in their habitat for my piece of mind  i fix them a fresh salad each day  but if i am out of town for a few days i feel a little better knowing that they have a vitamin enriched food if they get hungry enough  i change the food to keep it fresh  never because they have eaten it all  i wish my tortoises would eat it because i think that it is probably much healthier for them than their daily salad 
health	my shih tzu had diarrhea for a week straight  and yes i did mix it with his existing food  not saying its a bad product  it just did go well with my dog  in the past we have given him iams and blue wilderness  to be honest  never had a issue with iams  i do wish i could have returned  it was quite expensive for such a small amount  but to each their own  i do not regret trying it tho  it was worth a shot 
product	i got these for my small dogs  they are very small and perfect for their size  but my dogs did not really like them 
product	disappointed to discover this was made in china  will not give it to my dog 
product	my cat tends to lick the gravy and leave the meaty pieces behind  i just have to fake her out by pretending i am putting more of this in her food bowl when i am just dribbling a little gravy over the old pieces  sucker 
health	these are the stinkiest pill pockets we have ever used for our dogs  i can barely stand to open the bag  it is too bad i ordered so many without first trying one  greenies should develop an allergy formula that is more appealing to humans  let alone dogs 
quality	these treats are too hard for my senior doxie to chew 
product	item received was not same as pictured  clicker was not included  scam 
quality	i gave this to the people who board our cat when we are away  she said that someone else had given them one too  my cat would not go near it 
quality	good idea but my kitten is not interested  i use it as to go treat container for road trips with my kitten 
product	ordered 5 cases  pro  good price and delivery time  con  one of the boxes was damaged and 4 cans were leaking  very  very foul odor and nasty clean up  cannot determine exactly where damage occurred as outer box did not show damage  will be hesitant about trying this purchase again 
quality	my dogs stopped eating and developed anal gland issues from this food 
product	what i received was nothing like the picture and my dog ate through it no time at all  this product was soft and thin and not worth the purchase  i was extremely disappointed 
product	   please read edit below   <br  >i wished i would ve had these with my first st bernard   he died from osteosarcoma many year s ago  he could smell the pain medication from miles away  my current saint takes a whopping 17 pills day   hiding them in yummy people food was getting ridiculous  complicated   messy     i cannot use peanut butter because i am seriously allergic   will actually die  <br  >my saint even watches me put the pills in the pockets   drools  these pockets are really bouncy too   my baby will chase the ones that get away  i am glad pill time is not so stressful  like it was with my first saint   it made losing him a hundred times worse  pill time is easy   fun now     my big baby knows it is something special just for him  we have a rough road ahead   little things like this make all the difference <br  ><br  >   edit to my review   1 28 16     <br  >i did have a 5 star rating  but just reduced it to 2 stars  i still use these regularly for my dog   his massive daily pill intake  every so often since i ordered these  i would receive a bag or 2 of badly crushed   or broken up pill pockets  i do not mind an occasional messed up pill pocket  but it has been getting more   more frequent  out of the 8 bags in my last shipment  7 of the bags contained pill pockets that were mostly crushed  broken    in lots of tiny pieces  the bags appear to be intact   in good shape though  sometimes they are packaged by amazon next to heavier items in my order  but that does not seem like it could do the damage of breaking them into so many tiny little pieces <br  >i have to keep using these  because they really hide the pills  but it is a hassle   an inconvenience gathering all the little fragments   squishing it around the pills  i am guessing this is happening at the factory   so if anyone is reading this  please correct the quality  these are pretty expensive   should work as intended 
product	probiotics for dogs probably would be good but the amount you have to give a dog weighting 130  makes this product too expensive 
product	for a product meant to be used in a fish tank  it came in absolutely no condition to be used immediately for that purpose  these pieces of wood were simply picked off the ground  cut  stuffed in a bag  and shipped  when they say untreated  they really mean untreated  they were not even washed  or for that matter dusted off  they arrived filled with at least a pound of dirt and sediment  which i had to knock off  and then poke out with a screw driver  over the ensuing month  i had to boil and soak these pieces of wood at least a dozen times to remove the excess dirt  sediment and tannins  if you do not follow a similar procedure to clean and water log these pieces of wood  they will turn your aquarium into something resembling iced tea  i gave them 3 stars  because i am using them exactly in the manner i had intended  and they really are beautiful in my tank  the lattice like holes  and the center hole give this wood real personality in a tank  the fish and crayfish in my tank seem to love it  the pieces were also very nice sizes  and the center holes are large enough for small shrimp and crayfish to hide and live in  my only complaint is how filthy they were on delivery  and the amount of preparation and treating i had to do before i could use them  i wish they had at least cleaned off the excess dirt and sediment  i probably would have given them another star 
quality	my cats are usually not picky nd like all the temptations snacks but they do not care for the surfer s delight at all won t even try it 
quality	i got this brand rather than the brand i usually got because this was economically priced  however  our little dog  afraid of thunderstorms  would not eat it  i even broke it into 3 pieces and mixed it with her dry food  but she picked each piece out and laid it on the floor beside her dish and finished her food without even sniffing the   34 chillout  34  again  it is not effective if the dog does not eat it 
product	hard like a rock  my dog hated it  i bite it to test and it almost broke my front teeth  in addition  it is poorly packaged   the cover of the bucket does not seal 
product	we have ordered bixbi treats a few times for our dog  and she loved them  however  the last time we ordered these treats  we noticed the chicken treats were slightly discolored  a little more gray than when we had gotten them the first time  and smelled off  we are disappointed that the quality appears to be inconsistent and will not risk purchasing again 
health	my cats have more loose stools with this food  i mixed a little regular dry cat food to help them digest this  most likely will try another brand once this is finished 
quality	purchased 12 bags in may  half my order was fine  the other half  6 bags  of my order were so hard and dried out that i could not seal the greenie around the pill  all the pill pocket did was crumble and break apart  very frustrating  not sure what the issue is or where the problem generates from as i have been using this product for years and this is the first problem i have come across 
quality	do not like any of these products any more  believe them to be too bad for anyone  use product from dr  mercola instead 
quality	i bought this at a great price through amazon  the only issue is my dog does not like it anymore  and i have not finished the big bag   he liked it at first  but then stopped liking it  i was excited to buy it because i feel hill s science diet is a better quality dog food  but it does no good if my dog will not eat it 
product	these are not   34 extra thick  34  as advertised    will not buy again
quality	for the first time  amason has been trying to communicate with me  and i have to send it back  from the time i received the goods to the payment for 2 months  the perfect solution  unfortunately  my cat does not like to eat 
quality	not sure  what the problem is  but our dog will not eat this flavor   he likes all the other flavors we have tried  but rejected this from the get go <br  >so we are back to venison and bison  
health	really hard  we give our dogs a rawhide treat every night and when we gave the dogs these treats it took them an exponentially longer time to eat them  then one of dogs broke a tooth on one of these rawhides and we had to get the tooth extracted 
quality	my maine coon cat with uti problems will not touch these treats at all  my other cat will not eat it either <br  ><br  >i take issue with the fact that these are labeled as   34 treats  34  when both of my cats seem to hate it  i wish i had chosen a different product and had listened to the other reviewers that said that their cats would not eat them  my cats would probably tolerate capsules or tablets better than these 
product	i got these after previously purchasing the purebites chicken treats  i used those to shred up onto of my dog s food  which they love  i was hoping to do the same with these  but they do not really shred up at all  even after a run in the food processor    to be fair  they do not really say that they do  but i wanted to point that out  the dog s like them  but not nearly as much as the chicken treats 
health	i am having trouble with zoa eating nudibrach on 1 rock  i dipped the zoa rock and a lot fell off i dipped again a few days later and more came off  i got a new rock of mushrooms and decided to dip the zoa rock when i dipped the mushrooms and more came off <br  >i thought after 4 dips they were gone  but i came home one day and there were big nudis on the zoa again <br  >i finally went to my fish store and they sold me some iodine and i dipped them in the iodine mixed with ro water  there must have been 30 nudi of different sizes and a lot of other bugs  probably good guys buy casualties of war  laying in the bowl <br  >so i cannot say that this stuff will not help stop pests from getting into your tank  and it does kill some nudis but it did not take care of a infestation <br  >i do plan to use this on all corals i buy in the future 
quality	my birds do not like it and it is filled with a lot of sunflower seeds
quality	my dog do not eat that s    i do not know way
quality	my 105 pound dog does not like this dog food  he will only eat it if there is nothing else  will not buy it again 
health	my dogs did fine on the old formula of both epigen fish  what appears to be a new formula when the bags changed has caused problems with soft  waxy looking stool in one dog and blood in the stool in another  switched them both off and they are now back to normal stool with no problems 
health	compared to older formula which was without msm and existed a couple of years ago  this new formula with msm stinks  literally  unpleasant odor that does not smell like anything natural  but manufactured resemblance of something palatable  however my dogs still ate it  if it worked  i would gladly tolerate the odor i found terrible  but on my two dogs that need this kind of supplement for joint issues  i found that the studies applauding glucosamine with msm added to be superior  not so  my dogs ended up being ones that have stomach problems with this additive  runny stools and vomiting  and loss of appetite <br  ><br  >if i stopped the pills  they would recover in a couple of days  if i started them back  same things would happen  besides the loss of quality of life due to their getting nauseous and ill  one dog had noticeable improvement in his issues  but another it did not help enough that he still cried from his joint pain  i started them on osteo pet having had excellent results from another dog who no longer needed the supplements going back 3 years  i never recollected that dog getting ill on the pills  i searched desperately for that old formula that did not have any msm and was more simpler without all of the multiple herbs and vitamins that accompany so many of the canine versions today  even though i found some dealers showing the older labels as their pictures  i soon learned that this original formula apparently has been phased out  unlike syn flex liquid glucosamine label that still offers their original formula along with their  newer  improved versions <br  ><br  >while i prefer osteo pet because of the previous good results  i found myself having to try another manufacturer i have not used before who has a simpler formula without msm  but not happy that it includes vitamin c  while though lauded as beneficial  vit c is able to cause gastric upset  which i would avoid on my one sensitive dog  as i wait for this other unknown version my pets have never tried to arrive to my house  i wanted to try to keep both dogs from getting back their full blown pain  and decided to give them tentatively older osteo pet formula i still had stocked in my house from my other dog who had needed it but no longer did  i was glad to find that the unopened sealed bottle dated to the year 2013 that i had looked and smelled good as fresh <br  ><br  >it s smell by the way is enticing  and these 2 year expired pills were crumbly soft fresh  delicious to my dogs over this  newer  formula which has rock hard pills and an unnatural odor that reeks to me  any rate  i was surprised really  more than delighted that not only did my dogs have zero issues with the older pills  but had marked improvement within 24 hours to their pain so these older  expired  pills still packed a practical punch  and more amazing  within 3 days  unlike this  newer  formula which i tried for 6 weeks with issues and weak results  both dogs had 90 percent improvement that they seemed to never have any joint problems  wow     two years expired and the older formula not only still held its olfactory appeal and freshness  but apparently still carries potent beneficial results mild on my dogs stomachs and have zero interference with their quality of life which goes out the window when nausea rules <br  ><br  >it seems today near every pet supplement manufacturer wants to jump on the msm bandwagon and stack these supplements with the most vitamins and herbs to outdo one another  this may work for some dogs  but it is my regret that osteo pet decided to kill off their great original formula which does wonders still now  in my house at least outdoing this msm combination that some pets cannot tolerate  contrary to what some studies are claiming  on my pets just the glucosamine and chondroitin is not an inferior treatment  but instead superior to those supplements that have msm  not just for the tolerance reasons  but in the beneficial results  while i have to make use of this other glucosamine from another manufacturer i am waiting to be delivered to my home  it is with reluctance because it includes that troublesome vit c that troubles my one dog  i sincerely hope that osteo pet brings back the original into their product line  giving it as an alternative to those of us whose dogs just do radically poor on the msm or multi vitamin herbs versions out there too harsh on my dogs stomachs <br  ><br  >i want simple results with the least issues to my dogs  more is not necessarily better  studies are not necessarily true across all animals  and so there will remain a market of buyers needing simpler older formulas that have worked is other glucosamine from another manufacturer i am waiting to be

product	these big bags are full of rejects from the factory  misshaped  distorted  small and sharp pieces  very disappointed 
health	ferrets hated this food  were not interested  then have them tummy upset so bad they had to be put on meds  it has raisin juice which is terrible for ferrets and not safe around dogs in the house 
quality	my cat loved these treats  i mean loved them   <br  >however with this purchase the product has changed     the salmon bits seem to be made differently from previous purchases  <br  >she does not like them any longer 
product	the dogs ate these and seemed to like them  i would not say they chilled the dogs out though  i would not buy again because there is a lot of better dog treats out there for our pups  i will say they are made in the usa which is a huge plus because anyone who buys treats or dog food from china are crazy 
health	my dog loved it but threw up shortly after eating it
product	pretty expensive and small amount for the cost  the dogs did like it  but i would buy it again  just throw in some peanut butter and call it a day with your kong toys lol 
quality	my dogs do not like this food  it seems watery and does not go as far as the natural balance canned food i generally use  it is inexpensive but that is the only thing i liked about it 
health	do not buy this product  made my dog sick  it took us a month to figure it out  i will never buy a product that is made for consumption from china 
quality	good bird food i am sure but my bird is crazy picky about what she eats  sadly she will not eat this   
health	these were on the verge of going bad and are now bad  the order i received only lasted less than a month into using them before my dog got sick  they smell funny and are discolored  i ordered them june 2015 with an expire date of oct  2014  i have more than 100 left because i still had some from an in store purchase  i will not order in bulk anymore and with such a short life span  i would raather spend a little more to have them fresh  greenies my dog does not thank you  very disappointed 
product	i have have bought this toy before  the idea is to keep my dog occupied for a while trying to get the treat out  this toy did not hold the treat in at all <br  >very disappointed  it is not worth the price to return so will just throw this one away  at least  i can use the refills with the old one 
product	my dog likes these  but we have had other ones she is more excited about  and seems to enjoy more  these are fairly dry  and make her pretty thirsty  would not buy again 
health	my shih tzu loves these and it is 100  salmon  like many animals  my dog has allergies to a lot of fillers  you would not believe how hard it is to find dog food without peas    however  it smells awful  i know it is fish but wooooow  i have to hold my breath when i open the sealed container and walk away before i take a breath again  i am very thankful for the type of container so it keeps the smell in but if i do not seal it all the way it will stink up my whole house  still  he loves it so i am not yet sure if i will buy again or if another type  not fish  is available and less stinky 
quality	they are not returnable  i bought 2 bags of chillout snacks and our little dog does not like them 
quality	my bird did not eat any of it  most went to waste  my reptiles would not even touch it 
product	these are quite large so they can be broken up to give to your pup in pieces   i do not really know whether or not they calm her down at all  but i do like that they are made of natural ingredients     my dog likes them so thumbs up 
quality	yuck says my cat   2 paws down  she use to love the fancy feast chicken appetizers but the   34 purely new  34  is a no go for her  she just smelled it and walked away  i gave it 3 tries on different days  same response  why did they have to change it  even my other cats who are not as fussy would not touch it  it does not look good either  grayish and watery   yuck  trying to find something to replace it  was hoping to find an online pet store who had some back inventory on the chicken appetizers but no luck   bummer <br  ><br  >  update 08 19 15  i did find a replacement for my cat who use to love the chicken appetizers  i found weruva paw lickin chicken  i love this name   she really likes it  it is similar to the chicken appetizers from fancy feast  hope maybe your cat might like it also 
health	until just recently  any of the yummy chummies were soft and chewy  as advertised  well  no longer  i purchased 8 of them at costco  the original soft and chewy in the orange plastic bag  they were not the advertised   34 soft and chewy  34    they were absolutely toothbreaking  hard squares of over baked paste which seemed also to have some kind of binder   they even   34 shattered  34  when i had to break them apart to feed dogs  i returned them to costco  with their generous return policy  and called the yc number in anchorage  the clerk said that they now use an emulsifier to break up the bones  had anyone ever had trouble with bones  not to my knowledge    since they did not want to endanger the dogs  well  that just makes a paste and then they overcooked to which clerk explained that they wanted to kill any bacteria  this all sounds like a lot of hooey to me  an excuse to use less to get more product  so  folks  no longer will my dogs  favorite treats be in their treat drawer  these were the hardest little squares which even i had trouble breaking apart  my bigger dog did not even bother to chew  just swallowed whole  not good  and this company  once my hometown favorite  has morphed into something i will not even claim as one of my favorite chums  i will order this bag  foil  for one more go  amazon  there are other comments like this about this product  please check them out 
product	disapointed   when i opened the package one of the bones was all crumbled very very disapointed  i have two dogs i cannot even give them the good one  as they will fight over it 
quality	i am sure it is excellent  but alas buddha   my ferret  was not at all interested in this flavor    he did  however  adore the chicken and turkey variety  s of this brand    maybe he just does not like the fishy smell  i think a cat would love it 
health	my cat s been eating purina beyond for 4 years  i switch between getting him this blend   the chicken and oat blend  and he always handles the change without problem  but as soon as we started a new bag of this  my cat spent the whole day puking   having diarrhea  it took 3 days to figure out what the cause was  the bag is not expired  it has to be a defective lot of food or a new  lower quality recipe  i will not be buying this again  we will see how the chicken   oat is  but i will definitely be on the search for a consistently good quality cat food 
health	if you are considering buying dog food here  please read  after feeding my dog this food  he was immediately sick  my vet told me to contact the fda who suspected mold growth in the food  they were right toxic mold in bottom of bag  i contacted ken s fish who was unresponsive  they store dog food among fish products in high humidity   heat which helps mold grow  fromm food is great  buy elsewhere
health	this food is not good  it is has grains and preservatives  you are better off getting wellness offer more expensive food  if your cat has urinary tract infections  as water to his food and try to de stress him 
quality	purine pro plan bright mind will require a period of time to determine if it works  it arrived on time  clancy seems to really enjoy it  but to be frank  he will eat anything that will not eat him first  he is 15  we will see 
health	made my dog vomit diarrhea  i have bought this duck jerky before but it was just dried duck meat  this product seems different like there is other stuffed mixed in it and with pureed duck meat  to be fair  i tried giving this to my dog twice  each on two different occasions  and both times ended in unfavorable results  other reviewers  dogs seem to like this stuff  also  this product is made in china and not in germany as printed in the description and as pictured with words   34 product of germany   34  false advertising  i would not recommend this product to anyone i know 
product	i am giving this one star because one is lowest option  it deserves zero stars  i had to take this ball away from my dog within a minute of giving it to her  i was not expecting this to be a hard plastic ball  why would anyone make a dog toy out of hard plastic   my dog is not a chewer but she did try biting the ball to get the treats out  in less than a minute i could see that she was going to break the ball and possibly her teeth  her gums were bleeding  she s a 4 year old 60 pound dog with a healthy mouth  and the paint was coming off  why would anyone paint a dog toy   this so called toy is made in china so the paint on the ball is probably toxic  the   34 squeak  34  sounds like a tiny duck gargling  a sound that is rather annoying  the product description is a total lie 
health	gave my poor baby an upset stomach  diarrhea   yuck  trader joes makes a nice version that never upsets his stomach  please save your pup s tummy and try those instead 
health	this is a very dangerous product  my cocker spaniel chewed it and large pieces broke off which she swallowed  several days later she was at the vet with bloody stools  the chunks were too large and got stuck  thankfully numerous enemas worked or she would have had to have surgery  which they were off the market  
quality	cats would not touch and a big waste of my money  go with the oral gel  that stuff rocks 
product	quite disappointed    does not seem to be effective     poor dog got no relief 
quality	my four legged companion turned her nose up in the air when i offered one of them to her  it is basted pig ears only for her  now what do i do with the other 11        
quality	my cat will not touch these  i thought since she likes to hunt bunnies in the yard these would be a nice treat  but she will not even sniff them after one taste 
health	my vet told me to get this for my dog who was having a problem with loose stools but this is very inferior dog food  i think vets are given extra money to push this brand by hills but the ingredients are not good for dogs  i finally realized i was feeding my dog too much of the quality food which was resulting in diarrhea  higher protein means you need to feed a lot less so that is what i am doing now and it is working out great  i am feeding him first mate which is a very high quality canadian brand 
health	it seems a lot of animals get sick from china products it is not fair to not disclose country of origin and u s distributers looking for bigger profit <br  >google irradiation     
quality	too hard for my puppy  i wish they were not quite so crunchy  better for bigger dogs 
product	not worth the recent  4 00 increase recently applied  my dog likes these but there are other treats he likes also that cost much less and nutritionally good
health	i used this brand for several months and the first bag i purchased from here caused severe food allergies with my dog  not sure if from here had anything to do with it but i was forced to switch food 
product	very disappointed only one tube had product the rest were empty
quality	my dogs do not like these  they love treats and munching on feet and bones  but they do not like these at all 
product	we have 3 dogs  and their   34 habits  34  were extremely annoying  used the tablets last time  which worked great  i accidentally ordered the soft chews  and they do not seem to work as well  did not save the old bottle  or i could have compared ingredients 
product	the food came in and was way past due  it did not seem like it was fresh  my cat was disappointed 
quality	unless you are using very hard treats this will not work  it is too hard and too inflexible 
quality	these did not work very well for my cats or dog since the pockets fell apart after the pill was inserted causing them to refuse to eat them 
quality	way too big for my two jack russell terriers  plus  it stinks like bad rubber  too expensive for what i got 
product	i have two jack russell terriers  they hated this toy  way too big for them  plus  it stunk like really bad rubber for a couple of weeks  they weill not play with it as a squeaky toy  which is why i bought it   i never put treats in it  way too expensive for this end result 
health	the food pellets are very small  they are not less hard than regular dry cat food  i gave this to an old cat who has since passed  he tried to chew on this food because i heard a crunching sound  most cats would probably swallow the tiny food pellets whole  but he liked to chew his food  he ate a little bit  he only ate it one time  he would not touch this food after that <br  ><br  >the ingredients include  chicken  corn gluten meal  rice  brown rice  corn  chicken fat  soy isolate  pearled barley  rice hulls  that is a lot of corn  rice  and grains    those are not the most nutritious foods for a cat  soy isolate is not good either  i have read articles that say soy products in cat food can potentially cause seizures  allergies  thyroid problems  and even brain damage  soy is added to pet food because it is a cheap source of protein 
product	my puppy is entertained for about a couple of minutes until all her kibble is gone  she actually do not even shew this and is only interested if there is food in it  i put her kibble here and it takes some time for me to add it one by one and can be a bit annoying 
product	we live in wisconsin and ticks were bad this spring and early summer  our new vet recommended a flea and tick product  our older dog seemed ok the day i put the stuff on  but 3 4 days later she began seeming a bit tipsy and lacking appitite  she began drooling a lot  and general lethargy  she has not even wagged her tail in days  because of the delayed reaction i did not tumble to the connection until another 24 hours had passed  i then put 2 and 2 together  i called the vet  they recommended a bath and supportive treatment  entice her to eat and drink  make sure she poops and pees  and watch for any setbacks  i brought her in and bathed her with dishwashing soap and have been hand feeding her anything i can get her to eat  and sitting with her just petting and holding her  our situation may be different than others  but i would not recommend this product for an older dog that may be more sensitive  my dog is a 15 year old english shepherd  she did not tolerate this product well  in fact a lot of tears have been shed thinking we may lose her  we still hold onto hope that she will bounce back  but we are doing our best to love her through this  she is 48 lbs so the 21 55 pound dose should not have been a problem  i will never use another product like this on her ever again <br  ><br  >as for the seller it was as advertised  was packaged well and shipped quickly  they met all expectations 
product	for some reason the fish do not really go for the flakes but love the pellets 
product	was hesitant to get another treat back with the metal hinge to open close  sure enough one week in the thing is broken in a partly open state  not worth it 
product	we had high hopes that this would help clear the particulates in the water  we normally have crystal clear water in our 1800 gallon koi pond  but when the high temps of summer hit we had an algae issue which is not uncommon  we were hoping this would speed up the process of clearing out the small particulate matter as described by the manufacturer  we did the math and used the correct portion of the product for our size pond and were very disappointed  it turned the water a murky white and even after three days it is no clearer than when we started  fortunately the issue is seasonal and i expect it will clear up here soon with a bit more aggressive filter cleaning and some fine mesh skimming  but i cannot say the water clarifier has helped at all  on the good side    it did not kill any of our koi or the ornamental gold fish 
health	i have ordered this a few times before without any issues  this time it made my baby  90 lb pit  very sick and he threw up  that day i was not completely certain they were the cause  a week later i gave it to him again and he threw up again  nothing makes him sick  to the point of throwing up  i am completely positive these are the cause  i am certain  so much so i am happy that this is not a local company 
product	when i offer this  both dogs give me a look that says they are both disappointed in me 
product	i am sure it is a fine product but none of my canaries or finches gave these biscuits a second look  i tossed them outside and the sparrows enjoyed them  they were inexpensive so i am not concerned with the money i spent  what is life if not living and learning 
quality	i hate to give a bad review to something i will not eat but my puppy would not eat these either  they looked and smelled fine but my schnauzer would only eat them if i placed them one at a time into her mouth  the point was for her to love them and come running for her treat when she obeyed  did not happen  do not know why  i guess dogs can be picky  too 
product	theban came with only about half the stick being larger in diameter than the pencil sticks of the 8 oz bag i tried before  i also weighed it on a food scale and it was only slightly over a pound  so  i was kind of annoyed that they were not all that   34 supreme   34  they are rather expensive for what you get even thought they are all natural and not full of chemicals and you can rust that they are fine for your dog  they are just so freaking expensive when you consider your dog is going to scarf down 1 a day  basically it is another utility bill per month to give these to your dog 
product	very disappointed  used product on 6 1  had to reuse again 6 21 as my dog was covered in fleas  today 7 5 again covered in fleas  this product was a lot of money  supposed to be a 4 month supply  i am now down to 2  and really not comfortable applying on my dog after 10 days  will never buy product again 
quality	not worth the cost since most cats do not like it
quality	i am sure they are good but my rabbit does not like them 
product	was torn between 3 and 4 stars  these are the first elk antlers i have given my dog  so i have nothing to compare them to  other than the beef bones i used to order from amazon for him  the bones i used to give him were deteriorating in quality  and breaking off in pieces that he would swallow and gag on    which is why i came looking for antlers  these antlers seem high quality and they were a good size  about 1 5 inches in diameter at the base   75 inches in diameter at the tip  and about 8 inches long   but they are so expensive  i do not know if they are worth it   especially since my dog only seemed really excited about it for the first day    then he mostly lost interest  which is what he usually does with bones  i was just hoping he would super love these things   i will probably go back to using raw bones from the butcher  even though they make a little bit of a mess  i guess i would give these things 4 stars if you are rich or if your dog stays interested in chewing on things for weeks before losing interest  also  be warned that cracking or chipping teeth is a real concern with any bone or antler  so check your dog s teeth often if you do give these kinds of treats 
quality	i am sorry to say that many of the cans were open upon arrival  this flavor is my cat s best favorite  for some reason amazon price on this particular flavor was significantly higher than others for a long time  so i always bought them at the local store  when i saw this lower price i was thrilled and ordered the case  it arrived in a intact shipping box  but when i opened the top of the box the smell of the leaking juice overwhelmed me  seemed like each side of the case was banged heavily by something  resulting all outer cans were straight on one side  losing its round shape  this impact lifted the pull on lid slightly in each can  and juice was pooling lightly on top of it  the funny thing is that the shipping box did not show any damage at all  i have to think that this damage was happening already before they packed into the shipping box  i counted how many cans had visible open lids  with leak   and i had to throw away 8 of them immediately because i have no idea how long it has been open like that and worried about rotten contents  the cat food inside those cans were very runny and did not hold its shape of can when tapped inverted  then 3 more cans just smelled so bad after washed under running water  assuming they had a micro leakage invisible to our eyes  i had to throw away  the rest of the cans are still sitting in my garage  i do not know if i should even keep them or throw the whole thing away <br  >i thought of taking a photo and submit to amazon for a refund  but the smell was so bad that i just wanted to get lid of them asap 
quality	it is probably my cats  but they were not interested in the pawbreakers  on the plus side  it sure beat the mess of loose catnip 
product	we were very disappointed to find this come without the applicator tip pictured  photo 3 4   we needed to buy a dropper separately to fill and use  as far as whether it clears up ear mite issues  after the suggested 2 wk application period using an ear dropper  we got separately  did not work as well as the oral syringe  do not administer orally  to squirt it into the ear  in the end we used treatment from sentry brand for better results 
health	we used this on our 12 pound dog on june 12th  it is now july 3rd and this afternoon we found fleas all over him  never using this brand again  banfield animal hospital said they no longer tell people to use this brand because fleas have become resistant to it  whatever the case is  this was a total waste of money and it was our poor dog that suffered because of it  do not buy it 
product	none of my cats liked these treats <br  >they have an intense fishy smell  and that my cats seem to hate <br  >not worth the money at all 
health	going to be honest  the color of the greenies look faded compared to the ones you buy at the store  not saying they are good  but we also noticed our 3 mature shih tzu s got all sick and could have been anything but noticed them getting better as we went away with these greenies and got fresh greenies from the stores 
quality	mostly worms which my beardie does not care for unless they are alive  but she did eat the crickets and grasshoppers 
product	i have never been that fond of the hill s brand as a pet owner  but one of my cats was gifted a small sample package from the vet and he went crazy over them  so being the awesome pet parent i am  i broke down and bought another package before he began plotting my death  the other three cats snub their noses at it every time i give them one  so i guess this is one of those treats where they either really like it  or they hate it  on the bright side there is no coloring in these treats like some of the ones you will find on the market  and the first ingredient is chicken 
quality	these were chewy and smelled funny  our dogs even turned their noses up at them  we gave them to my sister and her dogs gobbled them right up 
product	flimsy and poorly made  good idea but they need to use a stronger fishing line when stringing the beads  ended up returning item without any issues 
product	received my product on the 2nd and today the 3rd i opened it up and it was damaged      i do not want to feed my geckos this that is why i said one star but other then that i will give all stars as soon as i receive a replacement   which says it will he here sunday
health	it is just okay  i bought this for my dog previously  and he enjoyed it  and there were no problems  however with the latest bag  expires june  2016 batch  he has not wanted to eat it  there is occasionally blood in his stool  and he has thrown up nearly every day  my vet and i believe it is the food he is eating  he will eat other food readily  perhaps this is a bad batch  my wife says she has read evidence of this elsewhere online   
product	i goofed and thought i was getting 6 boxes  this is way too expensive for one box of milk ones  should be about  3 00 
quality	my blue front amazon and blue and gold macaw do not like it 
product	mixed grill is one of my cat s favorite food  friskies needs to make a cleaner product  the last few years i have tried their canned food it has been bad  so  i do not buy any more 
product	dogs love it  however  too expensive and takes a long time to arrive 
health	my cat loved these  but he was allergic to them  my cat gets ulcers on his skin and face due to allergies  and unfortunately a day or two after i gave him one of these his lip started to swell  he loves to chew on things  and these treats were no exception  but if you have a cat with allergies these probably will not be any good 
product	this is a very soft treat in stick form  you can break pieces off easily and make them into smaller treats <br  ><br  >my 6 month old labradoodle can finish this in less than 3 seconds  not really a great treat for the money <br  ><br  >the kong ziggies are much better at occupying the dog for longer  a flavored rawhide chew is also a better value if you want your dog to be occupied for a while with the treat instead of finishing it within seconds 
health	my dog got stomach upset with the fresh and beef flavors  i will stick with the traditional one  i guess if your dog does not have a sensitive stomach  it should be fine   
quality	i attempted to give these to my cat  who normally gobbles up any sort of canned food   but he downright refused to eat it  he licked at the sauce a little bit  but the   34 filet  34  parts were compacted layers of mystery meat    that looked more like the inside of corrugated cardboard  wound up throwing the whole box out 
product	my wife   i used as instructed but it did not ever work  i was told this product was the best out there   i might try it again might got a bad batch
product	i am really confused about all the good reviews  maybe we have   34 super  34  fleas in louisiana  i bought this based on 1  the great reviews and 2  the great price  i have 65lb inside dog and a cat that comes inside every once in a while  i normally buy flea control from my vet  but i figured i would give this a shot <br  >three weeks after using this for the first time i noticed my dog literally covered in fleas  i bathed her good and reapplied the petarmor  again it did not work and she was covered in fleas in just two weeks <br  >i know that cat brings fleas into the house  she has been for 8 years  but  the flea control i get from my vet  although it is 3 times more expensive <br  >not only kills fleas on my dog but also controls them in my house  i will not be buying this product again and i am very disappointed in it 
product	this products work for about a couple of weeks tops  after that it is potency falls dramatically and your dog goes back to scratching because of ticks and fleas  i do not recommend it  if you want to save you some trouble  buy a better product for more    it will actually save you   in the long run and   34 your dog will appreciate it  34   i bought bravecto chews  they are expensive  but wow  they do exactly as advertised 
quality	it is very healthy for cats and they love it  however  it makes their feces stink horribly  great for the feral i feed 
product	i bought these and the bento ball for my american bulldog  he chews through things so quickly i thought this might slow him down  it lasted less than 20 minutes  not worth it to me
product	i got these for my 6 year old cat because he has a build up of struvite crystals in his urine  he does not really like the treats  i give him about 5 treats every morning  he loves the temptations brand treats and most other brand treats  he eats those as soon as i give him them  but now that he needs special urinary food i want to switch his treats to urinary ones too  these treats he will sniff them  maybe eat one right away  let them sit there most of the day  and then finally eat the others over night  he is not very impressed with them 
product	too expensive for what you get  this was more of a deer antler than an elk antler  other elk antler s are more durable and lasted much longer 
health	unfortunately  these give my dog diarrhea  she became   34 addicted  34  to these treats and would not do anything unless i repeatedly offered her the treat    lots of them  problem was    more than 5 in one hour gave her loose stools 
quality	kitty does not like this food that is why i give it 1 star nothing wrong with the product when i received it 
quality	my picky dog liked it the first 2 times he ate it after switching from purina one  however  since then he does not like it and will only eat it if i hold out on him until he eats it  usually takes 2 days  he prefers the science diet chicken  patte  over this stew and merrick s over that <br  >can does have an easy tab for opening 
health	this stuff is disgusting   they do not show you the ingredients list do they        cats are disgusted by light hairball  run do not buy this junk  ingredients  since amazon and mfr  do not think you even care  include as follows  chicken  brewers rice  corn gluten meal   gmo   wheat gluten  powdered cellulose  soybean oil   gmo  pork fat            check out pork industry keeping pigs in self contained cages their whole lives so they cannot move or even walk til slaughtered   do you want to support that filth   whole grain wheat  fish oil    ok shall i go on  cats do not want this science diet lite  i will never support this disgusting excuse for food  my cat has cost me thousands in vet bills due to vaccines almost killing her  i love her to pieces  she is insanely intelligent and she is disgusted with this garbage  into the trash can just like friskies purina   we as consumers must make these companies accountable 
quality	at first may cat really liked it but after a few days he would not touch it  i think that he just wanted something different from what he had been eating but in the end realized that he really did not like it  he hates the   34 classic  34  style and even though this is   34 chunky  34  it is not that much different texture wise than the   34 classic  34   the   34 grilled  34  is much more to his liking 
product	this did not work at all on my cats  i do not know if the fleas are suddenly resistant or if they changed the formula because advantage used to work great for me  it was a a waste of money getting this 
product	my vet recommended me to buy this for my dog  package came quick but sadly it was opened on the back     i am returning this for sure 
product	our kitty did not like the salmon either  also did not like cod   it crumbles when you try to cut the large pieces  it also smells very fishy  i will not buy again 
product	i would be very careful in feeding this to dogs especially with smaller ones  i fed this treat to my dog and became ill i took her to the vets and they stated that the zukes turkey flavor treats most likely caused this  also i had another little dog who actually passed away recently with similar symptoms after consuming these treats  it is suspected that these turkey treats are what caused her death so be careful i am not writing this to be mean but one has to look out for there pets  this may have been just one bad batch but even still they can cause problems in some pets i have learned 
product	better than frontline because frontline has watered their product down to get the consumer to buy more  advantix for the first 10 days will repel fleas and ticks  it will not last a good 30 days as bayer claims  i am sitting here looking at the fleas in my dogs hair and this was 10 days after gave her this product  i bought the product from pet meds and will ask for a refund  i am not going to put up with a bunch of lies   i will try another product  frontline will last a good 4 days and then fleas
product	my puppy loved it and loved the chews with it  only negative is that if the chews get pushed in  there is no way to get them out  i have tried everything  frustrating and a waste of the treat 
quality	i think my dogs prefer junk food or something  they will not eat them 
quality	this came very small and my puppy could care less about it 
product	this is okay  i do find that you need to watch the size of the treats you put in it  too small and they fall out and too big and they get stuck in there and you will have one frustrated dog 
quality	my dog will not even look at these  he likes the regular greenies fine but for some reason  the mint does not get him excited 
product	i ordered the medium ball but the diameter was only 3  34  so not big enough to put treat in not the 4 5  34  advertised so returned without taking out of packaging and i had to pay shipping
quality	i have a small dog and she does not eat the tablets willingly  i have to break tab in 1 2 then wrap it in lunchmeat  i have waited 4 or 5 days to see if she changes  nope 
health	seems like a good quality food  and my cat likes it  the issue is that the kibble is so dark it is almost black   so when kitty pukes or has a hairball  as cats do  it is almost black and very difficult to remove the stains from the carpet  we are on round two of using a carpet cleaning machine and while i think we will eventually get the stains out  it is slow going  and we will certainly need a third cleaning with the machine at least  typical cat food pukes are not too bad   i use an enzyme cleaner and a rag and it comes right out   so this is an issue unique to this food  i canceled my subscription because i do not want to handle even occasional clean up when it is this difficult 
product	fancy feast has changed the recipe  when this was   34 appetizers  34  it was my cats  favorite treat  now it is called   34 purely  34   and fancy feast have added sunflower seed oil to what was just meat  and none of my three cats will eat it now  when i wrote to fancy feast  they told me they had not changed the ingredients  that is a lie  it is obviously different  and it is written on the package  i will be donating this to the local cat rescue  in hopes their cats will like it better  and i will not be buying anything else from fancy feast ever again  not only because they ruined my cats  favorite treat  but because they lied to me about it  if you are also looking for a replacement for this treat  i found petsmart makes   34 grreat choice purrrely divine  34  treats which are almost exactly the same as the old appetizers 
product	the cans have been dropped and damaged  out of the three cases  i have about twelve damage cans that have leaked all over everything 
quality	not nearly as hard material as they used to be  in fact  the two i bought at the same time were of two different hardnesses  though the packaging and color was alike  one was a lot squishier than the other  decided to keep them but definitely not the quality of the ones i bought a few years ago which was very hard  unyielding  you could not press in on the old ones  rubber  both these are squishy  they must have down graded their materials  and i predict they will not last very long  very disappointed as the old ones lasted years and my dogs loved them 
quality	my hammie will not eat this snack unless there is nothing else and she is truly bored  better to give fresh carrots to your little critter 
quality	my dog liked it at first  but does not care for it now
product	let me first say i have almost never had a truly bad experience with items i have purchased on amazon  i usually do a lot of checking around and reading reviews  these natural balance treats i have purchase locally are really good and my dog loves them  i decided to purchase my last bag online  a little cheaper that locally  i got two bags  this one and the sweet potato and venison  the sweet potato and venison was just fine  but  my problem with this bag of treats looks like someone played a game of football with the bag  i just opened it a couple of days ago and dumped the whole bag on a plate to see how many whole treats were in there  nine  the rest of the bag was nearly all crumbs  very disappointed <br  ><br  >also  when i purchase these locally for my mini schnauzer they are bite size  these are gigantic  the bag says for   34 puppies thru adults  34   maybe a puppy saint bernard 
quality	the cans were old  not pop top  but had to be opened with a can opener   cans were dented  and my animals would not eat them   although they eat that brand every day  will never buy the from amazon again  a complete waste of money  
quality	first impression     small amount in package  my two cats do not like it 
product	the first few times i purchased this product  they were fresh  in good shape  not crushed   and light in color  any subsequent ones i have received have been a dark color and foul  the product is too inconsistent in quality to warrant a good rating 
quality	do not order more than one box as amazon does not take back even unopened cat food    something to remember in case your cat does not like
quality	my two cats will not eat this food  i have a 2   6 year old cat  i do not give them dry food and they are fed twice a day  even when i leave the food out for their dinner  when i get up in the morning  the food has still not been touched  at this point  i would think they would break down and eat  either the food tastes really really awful  or possibly the product has something bad in it  i have given it the old college try  and have ended up throwing away 14 cans of this food  i will not order this again  but will continue feeding them the regular hills sciene diet canned cat food which sells for around  22 for 24 cans   5 5 oz per can in lieu of  32 for 24 cans that are half the size and the cats will not eat  😾😡😾

quality	too hard  too big for my little dog  she would not eat them  i probably should have ordered mini of other flavor 
quality	baby fish did not eat it  i was really hoping  i guess it is back to the real thing 
quality	my dog loves treat but he did not care for these too much
quality	maybe it is just my cats  but they could not care less about these  they prefer balls that jingle  light up  or make noise 
product	my english bulldog loves these   however they only last about 3 min and i got these because other reviewers stated that there were 2 bones per package  for a total of 16 bones per order    there isn t  there is only 8 bones  which makes a  30 price tag not a good buy    save your money and go to target where they are only 2 50 each 
quality	the product itself seems terribly dry to me  but the dogs like it  however in this case when the 2 bag set came one of the packages was crushed into bits and totally unusable  it was crumbs  i feel like it could have been better packaged and protected in order to get here in better condition  also  i feel that fantastic value should send me a replacement bag 
product	did not really control the fleas  treated the yard before application  i am sure the torrential rain was a factor     so i give you 3 stars 
health	this product really f s with your water parameters and puts many types of delicate fish into a shock phase as there are sudden spikes not only every day  but nearly every hour  it also messes with a cycled tank releasing bad bacteria into the water  shock   havoc on fish immune system   vulnerability to disease   expect dead fish causing a ammonia spike   more dead fish   more dead fish  if you have no job  responsibilities  or no wish to leave your house for a week    well you can monitor your tank    but what happens when your gh and kh shoot up and you cannot do any water changes  you can lower ph  reduce nitrates and ammonia  but what about your fish s  immune system  what about death from shock  what do you do when you have done days 1 3 and your fish start dying  your cycled tank is going crazy  and you have to wait 60 days for the cycle to return to normal  are you willing to risk losing your fish instead of doing regular water changes  i lost 1 thousand dollars in fish and i had to buy a entire new setup  another 2k  if you have cheapo petsmart fish  go for it  if you have discus and plecos  throw this out                            i have asked amazon to investigate this product  read up on it in a decent aquatic care forum  then decide  oh  yes it did make my water very clear though 
quality	half of the packages were too hard and nearly worthless to use for pills  also the expiration date was way to soon
health	my dogs loved these dingo sticks  as well as all of the dingo bones  but i stopped buying them after the stick got lodged in my pug s mouth  she was choking on it  and she would not let me help her dislodge it  thankfully  she saved herself and coughed it out  but the whole experience was terrifying  and i will never buy this stick shape for my dogs ever again  i recommend you do not either 
quality	my 12 year old chi just loves these  she is very  very picky  however  lately they are arriving stale  they are dried out and brittle  my dog no longer will eat them  two stars because this is the third time in a row that this has happened  cannot throw good money after bad 
product	made in china  i was fooled and bought it anyway  i sent it right back 
product	although my havanese loves these  they are made in china and cannot be found anywhere  petco discontinued them  although my dig lives them  i am strictly buying made in the us a only 
health	my dogs seem to like the taste and it did not cause them any gassy or vomiting issues 
product	these are made in china and it stated they were made in the usa 
quality	my dogs do not like them   waste of money for me  
product	i have used k9 advantix before and it worked wonderfully  but this time it has been horrible  my dogs still have fleas and ticks  april was fine  but it was not high flea tick season  in may i put it on the dogs and had to re apply within 20 days and it has not helped  they are still getting fleas and ticks  i am very disappointed in this product  lot no  kp09cvr kp09auj
quality	i am sure this product is as good as it claims   but my dog is still not eating much of it per day 
quality	i have ordered two different brands of freeze dried chicken before for my two cats  which they absolutely loved  decided to go for this variety pack to give them some more options  instead of receiving the turkey flavor  however  i received an organic chicken  which was extremely hard  so i ended up throwing away that entire bag  a waste of money because these are not cheap compared to the other brands i have bought previously   i do not know if that is a result of them being   34 organic  34  or whether it was just a bad stale batch  the chicken  non organic  flavor  one of my kittens seems to like  have not tried the other flavors yet  but hopefully they are edible for my kitties  i will adjust my rating accordingly based on the other flavors  edit  i gave my kittens the salmon and while they liked that one    it was very hard as well  i tried giving them the beef liver  which was also kind of hard  and they did not eat that flavor at all  even my little kitten who usually eats anything and everything refused to eat it  reduced to 1 star  a waste of money 
product	i am very disappointed with this product  two  2  of which i purchased  because i really needed something that would calm my 12 year old female dog who gets extremely anxious when loud noises are made   like the sounds of exploding fireworks  thunder   lightning  vacuum cleaners  bubble wrap being popped  finger     toenails being clipped  objects being accidentally dropped  gunfire  etc  she is even anxious when i bring home large cardboard boxes and or large plastic bags  so  i really thought i would found a solution to the problem when i read your product description  but after trying several   34 chill out   34  biscuits and finding my dog s behavior unchanged  i came to the realization that this item s claims are false    unfortunately  i have already tossed the packaging  so i cannot request a refund  believe me  i would if i could  i feel the listing has been deceptive 
quality	my dogs loved the larger ones and i would put the crumbled pieces on their food as a special treat  it is really hard to find treats that my 3 5 pound chihuahua will and can eat since his jaws as week and he is only got a few teeth left  these were perfect for him  soft but not chewy  i was disappointed when i received these and saw they were tiny little pieces but figured i would just give 2 treats instead of a piece of the larger one  this is fine for the other dogs and they still love them  the texture seems to be different now with the smaller size  it is not as crumbly and my little guy will not touch these at all now  since the larger  crumbly ones no longer seem to be available  i am back to searching for a treat that he can eat 
quality	my dog only ate these the first time i put them in her toy  but she will not touch them now  and she is totally food motivated  i like the size for training treats  they are about 1 4  34  round  i will give them to some friends for their dogs 
health	after being on this food for only a few days  one cat could not stop throwing up   the other could not walk on his back leg<br  >after taking them off the food   returning them to their previous food  they are fine again<br  >my daughter told me there are numerous problems with this food right now  recalls  lameness remarks on line  etc <br  >is there a way to do no star at all  
quality	too small  too hard to easily get into and out of
quality	hard as a rock  so my dog has to break it in half to eat it   which  as you can imagine  kind of defeats the purpose of hiding a pill in it  once the pill pops out  our dog will not eat it  back to greenies  
quality	the idea of this toy is to make your cat work for the treats inside  you slide the upper half to reveal the hole where you put the treats  then slide it back until only a small gap remains by which the cat can get the treat out  by pushing the ball around the room  unfortunately  the top does not stay where you set it  and it completely opens up so the cat can get all the treats with one swipe of the paw  it defeats the purpose entirely  and  though i love my cats  they are not all that bright  so the gap does not widen due to anything they did  like sticking in a claw and pulling   my cats love it because they can eat a ton of treats  i do not like it  for the exact same reason  i do not recommend this product 
quality	my cat loves wet food but he will not eat this  i tried feeding it to the neighborhood cats and they turn their nose up at it also  so now i am stuck with all these cans that i cannot return  i have not tried it myself so i could not tell you what it tastes like  oh well  back to friskies 
health	these seemed great  and our dogs love them  and we love that they are only 1 calorie each    until    we got to the bottom of the bag where the crumbs are and found a small worm that was alive eating on them in the bag  we do not have any infestation issues in our home  and keep the bag completely zipped except when getting some treats out  this little creature had to be in the bag from the manufacturer 
quality	despite many attempts to get my cat interested  he will not touch this  good idea  but for me it was a waste of money 
quality	stinky  look like wood chips  food like them but they really smell bad 
product	the vet recommended it so we try to feed it  our dogs do not really like it unless we start a game with them trying to grab it before the other one gets it  they do not fight  they just like to compete 
product	did not like  the color was darker than it was supposed to be  nothing like what is in the picture <br  >the price is way out of line as well  will not buy again  she was not even interested 
health	this picture is not what you get  you get a three inch retriever stick  the picture looks like a frisbee  that is why i got it  my dog cannot have retriever sticks  she chokes on them  hopefully this helps the next shopper  the item in the picture is not what you get 
product	i purchased this item and good n fun dog treats during the same time span in which my dog suffered kidney failure  my vet is almost certain that these made in china  which was also the case with good n fun  were the cause of her kidney issues  while i cannot pinpoint and say it was these treats and not the others and vice versa  made in china treats are known to cause these type of issues in pets  why take the risk when you can give your dog steamed carrots or sweet potato  please do not ignore this warning i would hate for any pet or owner to have to go through the financial and emotional turmoil my and my dog are going through right now 
health	i used this on 3 of my dogs   a dalmatian greyhound mix  a weimaraner and boxer beagle mix  my dalmatian mix had a terrible reaction  within 24 hours  she started acting very strange  she paced the house  would not settle  seemed very scared of everything and starting having periods of tremors  we had to go to the vet 3 different times  there is a chemical in this stuff called permethrin that is pretty much like poison  yes  it is poison to kill off ticks  but it is also harmful to dogs  what it did to my dog was give her the feeling of pins and needles all over her skin  the vet said that for some reason  white dogs tend to be much more sensitive to these types of topical solutions  since she did not know what was going on  she was freaking out  my husband and i had to come home from work one day because she was freaking out so bad  barking  crying  jumping   two different neighbors called us and asked if everything was ok  the solution to all this was to wash her in dawn dishwashing soap twice  rinse her in a warm epsom salt solution and then rinse her again  note   it is very important to use dawn and to wash your dog off within 48 hours of application  otherwise you may have to wait longer than a week for this to wear off  the vet also gave her a muscle relaxer to help with the tremors  it took a little over a week to have her back to normal  what a terrible thing to go through <br  ><br  >i will say my weimaraner did ok with this  my boxer beagle mix has been extra itchy  stick with frontline if you decide to use anything  it is not worth the risk with this stuff 
product	upon received this pet spray  used it as directed on couch and chairs    both cats immediately checking it out and curled up on the seat   they love it  sigh   very disappointed for the price 
health	our new little kitten    indoor only  fully dewormed  but he was having some sensitive tummy issues  we tried the gradual switch from the food he had been eating to this food and he started vomiting  at first it was only a little  but by day four or five he projectile vomited  a lot  i had no idea a cat could do that  definitely did not work for the little guy  we did find a solution for him  wanted to let others know before they buy a large bag to consider trying the smallest just in case   
product	this is not really light weight  it is light er  but it is not like another brand that is so light you can toss the jug around  i just prefer the clumping litter that is like sand  check out amazon s number one litter purchase   it clumps amazingly well 
health	terrible  she hates it plus it gave her diarrhea  i wish there was a way to get my money back  funny she loved the puppy food they make 
quality	this has too much straw  both my guinea and bunny hated it  actually  the bunny used some for nesting  but would not eat it  not even the flowers  it is cheap and only about 40 percent edible  if your pets are not choosy 
health	started giving to my dog with a few digestive issues  all the sudden he had the worst diarrhea he had ever had  i could not figure out what it was from because i did not think probiotics would do that as they are suppose to help but his bathroom issues got even worse as i continued to give him the probiotic  after four days of potty struggles i took the probiotic out of his diet and he immediately went back to normal <br  ><br  >hope it works for others but it made my dogs stomach issues so much worse 
product	it takes some considerable effort  and pain  to get these pucks in the small version of this toy  i bought it and a whole case of pucks and the pucks are now just rotting on my shelf because it is so much drama to load this stupid toy  also  by the second load my dog figured out how to hook her tooth around the edge and pop it right out  so it is 100  useless in every regard for me
product	applied a tube of advantix on may 15 and on may 21 found three ticks attached to my dog  re applied advantix on may 25 and before month end i found another four ticks attached  this product simply does not work  maybe a bad batch  maybe counterfeit procuct  i do not know   but i will not be wasting this much money on an ineffective product again 
product	this seemed to work  however  with 4 cats it is pricey  i am going to try something else for a while and see 
quality	had a very bad plastic smell and our dog will not go near it 
health	the greenies were very old looking  greenies are a dark green  however  the ones i received were light green with specs of dark green  my dog has a greenie everyday and never an issue  when i gave her the greenies from this shipment she had diarrhea for the couple of days i gave them to her  ended up throwing them away and went to pet smart and bought from there and she had no issues with those and they were dark green as always 
quality	the thing i do not like it is too close to expired date   i bought 3 times and it all had about 2 3 months to expire  because of the half of retail price i would like try one more time 
product	do not buy these to feed your crickets my cricket started to die like if it was a plague terrible product if you are looking for a cheap way to feed your crickets just chop up some carrots this is a waste of money
product	our hamster will chew a bit but mostly out of boredom  will not buy it again  also no description of content  i suspect using chemicals to obtain the color 
product	do not buy  my ferret even do not look at it 
quality	those are not strips they are biscuits and my dog does not care for
health	we have an 8 month old lab and he popped it out in 45 mins  also it ended up making him sick and he did not hardly eat any of it  the liver ones are better with him so i got those  i do not recommend this flavor of these treats  i also found the flatter ones starmark makes last longer 
health	i was super excited when i got these treats  they smelled amazing  i seriously almost wanted to eat one  unfortunately  the next morning i woke up to my dog throwing up  he vomited 4 5 times  i did not connect it to the treat and figured he just got into something weird  i gave him another treat the next day  and the next morning  the same thing happened  he is vomiting a weird orange ish bile  i realized that this was the only new thing in his diet so i suspected it could be the treats causing the vomiting  i stopped giving him these treats and he has not thrown up since  not sure if i got a bad batch or if my dog is just allergic to something in them  bummer 
quality	unfortunately my dog will not touch these  i have tried giving her all 3 colors and broken one in half and she hates them  6 month old golden doodle 
quality	two dogs   neither one of them is interested in it   at all  waste of money for me  other dogs may think it is wonderful  i think it is probably too hard  they prefer rawhide or toys that have some   34 give  34  to them  this is solid plastic 
quality	i have brought this product several times  and it has in the past been great  this time the product was dried out and hard  my dog would not eat them  very disappointed 
health	i have a 13 year old pomeranian who is the cutest dog  breeders do not breed these dogs for their longevity but for their adorable cuteness  my sweet little guy is so good natured and loving  he never barks  bites  or does anything destructive  he is the most gentle soul of the dog i have ever met  he is fragile however and after getting   34 fixed  34   neutered   his entire immune system and strength were compromised all his life  he is in better shape now in 2015 than he ever was in his life  i never give him dog food and still cook for him  i still give him micro doses of the herbal formulas on occasion when the weather gets cold and his limbs need a little more support  after all this work  i did not want to undo any of the progress we had made  as he is an older dog  i thought i would give this purina pro plan   34 bright mind  34  a shot to see if the dietary variation and what they say are the beneficial   34 enhanced botannical oils  34  a try  i purchased the five pound bag of the chicken and rice formula  i started giving my dog the kibble as little treats instead of a main food  just a small amount  like 10 20 kibbles a day while keeping him on his normal ration of home made boiled chicken and rice  within two weeks  my dog started displaying symptoms of discomfort and pain  like carpal tunnel syndrome with people  his paws and arms became stiff and hard and his knuckles became a little knobby and swollen  he did not have any of these signs since his recovery in 2012  so i looked at the bag to find out what the culprit might be  interestingly  here are some suspect ingredients    34     whole grain corn  corn gluten meal  whole grain wheat  corn germ meal  barley      34  really  corn  corn  wheat  and more corn  these ingredients  from my experience  are very clogging and degenerating to my dog  these sticky gluey ingredients might be okay for some dogs but my dog does not do well at all with any kind of gluten or flour grain products   except rice  and rice is not a true grain  rice is a grass  i contacted the purina company and spoke with one of their representatives and asked them what the   34 enhanced botanical oils  34  are  at first  they did not want to be very descriptive  eventually  the person on the phone told me what the   34 enhanced botanical oils  34  were  palm kernel oil and coconut oil  that is the magical stuff i guess  these oils  they claim  are enhanced  broken down  modified  and restructured  to be broken down into a slow process sugar for the brain to absorb  the words   34 enhanced botanical oils  34  carries with it an image of various herbal extracts and essential oils of which we hear so much about  however  this is not the case  it is palm kernel oil and coconut oil  that is the   34 enhanced botanical oils  34   i know that coconut oil is good for inflammation  can my dog do well on these oils  probably  he seems to be mentally doing okay   less stress  he seems to be a little a little more playful  could he do better without all the gluten and corn and wheat junk  yes  i do not want his system to be overloaded with food that inflames his arthritis and clogs his system  as soon as i took him off this dog food  within two days  his pain went away and he was no longer curling his toes or having swollen feet and joints  definitely doing better without the corn  corn  corn gluten  wheat  etc  the reviews for this product are amazing for so many people  however  for my sensitive dog  it is not worth the risk to continue feeding him this product or any other dog food with corn  corn sugars or corn and grain extracts  i would say that purina has a great idea with the added oils  but they should leave the wheat  barley  and gluten ingredients out  then they would have a super great product that even more dogs might benefit from  i would certainly give this a try if they could take out the corn and grain sugars  i would say try a small bag first  if your dog is prone to arthritis and gluten sensitivity which occurs with dogs who have digestive issues  neurological issues  or inflammation issues  you may want to skip this  if your dog is normally healthy without any problems except for getting old and mentally old  maybe it will work for you  it simply did not work well at all for my dog  sorry  but i wish it were otherwise  update  august 1  2015  i found a brand of dog food  that does not have corn and wheat gluten or chicken by products or turkey  i mix as a 1 3 portion of my dog s total consumption with the other 2 3 being boiled chicken and white rice  in addition  i added more electrolytes and potassium in particular  and started introducing a dab of virgin coconut oil and a few drops of agave nectar to my dog s food or let him lick it off my finger  the result  my dog started playing with his toys again and making more eye contact and appears to be more playful all around  and has much more energy  i cannot say that this solution will help anyone else s dog but it certainly helped mine e risk to continue feeding him this product or any other dog food  i would say that purina has a great idea with the added oils  but they should leave the wheat  barley  and gluten ingredients out  then they would have a super great product that even more dogs might benefit from  so where do i go from here  i will keep him on the boiled chicken and rice  with the variety of turkey now and then as usual  a vitamin  and joint supplement  and the occasional micro serving of the chinese herbal formulas to boot  and no more dog food  adding a little glandular supplements like bovine  cow  kidney  heart  and spleen  is very good also  just a pinch every couple of days helps fortify his own organs   amazon sells swanson brand and these are great quality and low cost   when he exercises  he gets electrolytes and a tad of agave as a low glucose sweetner to refresh his energy  he is walking   no  running and trotting very well  up until trying the dog food  and i want to keep him that way for as long as i can  he goes for hour long walks at a good pace when the weather is not too hot  i would say try a small bag first  if your dog is prone to arthritis and gluten sensitivity which occurs with dogs who have digestive issues  neurological issues  or inflammation issues  you may want to skip this  if your dog is normally

product	dogs love it    seems a bit pricey for what you get…i buy store brand peanut butter  3 and stuff the puppies kong with that and it seems to last 4ever  the stuff n easy is much easier to use  wish they would lower the price 
quality	theses were not moist at all  i specifically got this item  because my cat only likes moist treats  they are dry and hard  and my cat will not touch them  they do smell good though  so there is that 
quality	my dogs would not eat them   i crumbled them up in their dog food and they ate around it  the product is packed full of all the essential vitamins  etc   but they would not have it 
product	they were moist but quite tiny and too costly compared to other brands  my dogs did like these  however  another concern is mixed  they come in packets of two  that keeps them moist but if you only need one  you cannot keep the other one wrapped separately  it is as if the maker assumes the dog always needs two pills at a time  mine actually uses even more  but not all owners need to use two at a time 
health	please stay away from this food  i should have read other bad reviews before buying this product  last week i gave this treat to my dog  his poop was not normal  i stopped giving it and he came back normal  i thought it might be something else other than this treat  so stupid me  i gave him this treat yesterday again  he got completely upset stomach  got severe diarrhea  note my dog was completely fine before i gave him the treat  i had to call my vet as he suffered entire night <br  ><br  >in short   if you love your dog  please stay away from this food  i will not stop short from making a formal consumer court complain against this brand   i am amazed that amazon is still allowing them to sell on their website  despite having bad reviews 
product	i have been using this product for many years for my two devons who have fhv  the relatively expensive meds have been excellrnt until this order  about 1 3 of these two packets is crumbs  the most expensive dry crumbs going  usually the pellets are slightly moist and perfect  i will be trying other companies when these are finished 
product	we used this for several years until discovering much better products at costco  dogfoodadvisor com is a good review site and rates this product well  but not great  too much filler in it   van patten has long since sold this brand and the price has climbed steadily  while the quantity has dropped in packaging  this is about as good as any supermarket brand  but much more expensive 
health	the smoke flavor is so strong  the smell chokes me every time i open the bag  dog would not touch them 
product	dogs love these    and so do i  until i get about half way through the package when we begin to get into tiny pieces and finally dust that i have to sprinkle over the top of their dog food to gain the full value of the price i paid  when i first bought this i got it on sale for  12 for a 10 ounce bag     then it went to  16 and now  at last check today it was  17 70  i would be better off to buy filet migon <br  ><br  >later  the price went down to  11 something and that is a tolerable price   and now it is gone back up to  16 something  just too much money    i keep wondering why they fluctuate so much in price  i hope it does not mean the less expensive price is inferior quality product <br  >upate on feb 23  2017<br  >the price is now at over  20  our guys are very disappointed that the bag we have is their last bag    but this is just too much money  especially when you have 4 dogs 
product	far too expensive for   of pounds  purchased 50  all natural  soy free  non gmo locally for less than the 20  from h h 
quality	these are not the normal consistency of their top quality treats i expect  i am a professional dog trainer  am very familiar with their products over the years  these included  they are not soft  more crumbly and very messy to use break up  almost white pasty consistency for lack of a better description  not normal for this brand  very disappointed 
health	good god  this stuff is evil  had i known how dangerous it was i never would have bought it  i intend to return it asap 
health	i can no longer buy these because my dog got some of the rawhide stuck in her stomach and very sick  she survived but we will never give her rawhide again 
health	do not use on dogs with skin allergies  dogs were writhing by days end  had to give them baths to wash treatment off 
health	our vet recommended we try phycox to help our 8 y o  mastiff  it was getting tougher for him to jump and he loves to be on high surfaces   after successfully giving him a few samples  a friend mentioned she had a almost full container we could have because her dog was no longer taking them  they made a noteworthy difference  so i began to price them online when the container got low  i was pleased to find these on amazon at such a reasonable price  so i ordered them  i received phycox one and all three containers had expiration dates in 2017 <br  ><br  >shortly after we opened the first container  our dog lost interest in his kibble  i had noticed that the   34 treats  34  were more crumbly than the first container  but figured it may have to do with age or exposure to air  so wrote it off  too  we had gone on vacation  so at first we thought it was just separation anxiety  but when it continued  we started looking for another cause  finally  we took him to the vet because his tummy was making a lot of distressing sounds and he still was not eating very well  he was not vomiting or having diarrhea  just did not seem interested in his food   he had not really lost much weight either  but he clearly did not feel well <br  ><br  >after talking with our vet for a bit and reviewing kibble brand  etc   he asked me if i had purchased the phycox from him or online  i told him i got them online and he let me know he had had one other dog with similar symptoms  owner had also purchased online  and after talking with his phycox rep  he learned that there are folks selling fake phycox  which is indistinguishable from the real thing  he emphasized that there was no way to know for sure  but that if we find something online that is notably cheaper than what he sells it for  to beware  since i had been given the first container  i did not have a reference point for how much it should cost   <br  ><br  >so  we have stopped the   34 phycox  34  for now and we are giving him an rx to absorb whatever weirdness might be in his system  our vet also mentioned that tricox might be better for our pup  so we will likely try this once we have got him eating regularly again  be cautious  if i find anything more out definitively  i will update my review 
product	i was so disappointed in this product  it was so small  my dog devoured it in a day  for the price  i thought it would be larger and keep my dog busy for at least a week 
product	i was a little disappointed by this purchase simply because the bar used to screw together the toys really is not needed  i have a fireplug and have not had a problem with the treats coming out  in fact they are pretty difficult to even get in the toy  i could see where if you had a different you design it might work better but my dog would probably just chew it up right away  for the price i think it is better just to buy the single or double packs of treats without the middle piece 
health	i have three dogs   the largest threw up after taking her heartworm medication in the pill pocket  when i give it to her in cheese or just push it down her throat she has no problems  the other two dogs did okay so i will probably keep using it for them  but i will not give it to my big dog anymore 
quality	just like the barkworthies long curly bully sticks   poor quality and horrible smell  dog chews them up too fast compared to others i have given him  they smell like bison poop  after giving the stick to the dog  definitely wash your hands because it will smell like it 
product	i have ordered numerous times without any issues  past order came and all the bags were squished  the pill pockets are in pieces inside the bags  very frustrating  amazon usually does a better job than this   
quality	this is the worst product i have ever purchased  only buy this product if you have a separate restroom area for your cat or else you will start puking as soon as you get inside the restroom  the smell is just horrible  i started having headache due to the pungent smell  i feel really sorry for someone who cleans after their cat using this litter  this is my first time writing a review to anything and i am so sorry it is this negative comment  i bought this product and only used it once and never will go back to this product ever again  i am not sure what am i going to do with the rest of the bag full of this litter  total waste of money 
quality	not sure why but our dog just does not like it 
quality	my dog would not touch them  i gave some to my neighbor for her dog and he threw them up 
product	i have used frontline before  but this stuff was defective  did not work at all  i am not sure if i got scammed or what  but this could explain why it was so cheap  buyer beware     do yourself a favor and just spend the extra few bucks and get it from your vet or petsmart          
health	i really do not want to give this less than 5 stars  but my rescued russian blue  daphne  failed to lose any weight eating this  and she also began vomiting every few days <br  >my other cats are doing very well on royal canin special 33  so i have put dapne on this instead 
product	my dogs love these but contrary to the packaging description  they are not odorless  they still smell pretty bad but not as bad as other bully sticks we have tried  these are pretty expensive for what you get in my opinion 
product	it was a good deal before the price increase  i stopped the automatic delivery  my dog loves them but they go on sale every couple of weeks at my grocery store  cheaper 
health	after both of our dog got extremely sick after eating this treat  each are on different daily food diets  i looked at the back of the container the treats were in and realized they were made in china  the treats we buy from the same company locally are made in the usa and have had no problem with them  they were vomiting a few hours later and had diarrhea for about 3 to 4 days  the vet said it must have been from the treats since that was they only thing they both ate in common and the symptoms  i am so grateful they did not die  i hope the company that sells this item checks out their products for safety  the expiration date was 119nov2017 and the bar code number was 8 73199 0004 1 
quality	cat does not finish it  it dried out to quick  i have to add broth to it so it stayed appetizing for him
health	warning  sharp bone found in treat  as a precaution  i always cut or tear any treats my chihuahua eats  this was our first time in purchasing the dehydrated chicken pieces  yes  it is chicken and chickens have bones but cautious and caring dog parents should be forewarned in the product description when buying these treats  there is nothing on the bag  front or back to indicate there may be bones in these treats  the piece i found had a very pointy end  i have attached a photo for others to see  i buy full moon chicken bacon regularly and have never had a problem  i will finish the bag of dehydrated chicken treats  but will examine each piece carefully and urge anyone that buys this product to do the same when giving them to small dogs 
health	these treats stain like cheese puffs  messy  also gave my pup loose stool and it was rusty red 
product	this can filled only 2 kongs 1 time  not worth the price  use peanut butter instead 
product	i love this product  but i am disappointed in the recent price increase  it used to be an add on item for  2 99  my dog eats these too quickly for it to be worth the current price 
health	these treats contain garlic  aspca list of harmful things for dogs to eat includes garlic  tried to return and was denied  not giving them to my dog  just stuck with them 
quality	dog hates it and he eats anything  he actually spit it out right in front of me and at me  and walked away 
health	product does not work in florida  the fleas are immune to it and my dog was still infested with fleas  the vet told me that the florida fleas are resistant to flea repellents except for comfortis and trifexis  although these are prescription drugs as they may cause seizures in some dogs 
product	well  we used to buy greenies for our dog and our cats all the time  that is  until we got a cat that was allergic to corn <br  ><br  >these things are mostly corn meal <br  >if you have a pet with itchy skin  you might want to try and see if corn meal is creating a reaction  just like with people  corn can be highly allergenic and cause gluten problems <br  ><br  >the small amount of chlorophyll for their breath is not worth a tradeoff of itchy skin and bloating for our cat <br  >no more greenies for us  and now that i know they are mostly corn  i admit   i never used to be a label reader   i would not buy them for a dog either 
health	i had been using these for a few years with my doxies and labs  i noticed one day that one of my small dogs was choking so i pulling out about 4 inches of the tail end chewed around a very sharp bone  i could cut cardboard with this bone  so i thought no more for them  but certainly the labs could chew through it  wrong  not a week later one was stuck in the roof of her mouth  luckily no damage  but she could not close her mouth or get water and she was panicking  i cannot imagine what might have happened if i had not seen her in time  like a lot of treats we take chances  but this one is not one to take on a small dog or large because a large breed could just swallow it all together and then you need surgery to remove it 
product	my dog tore this apart in 20 minutes  i would not buy another 
quality	these have a lot of potato in them and they make my dog pass stinky gas that smells like potato   
quality	the odor they omit is very strong  my dog does not like it the way he has other brands  i will not purchase again 
health	yes this product works  what troubles me is the ingredients  after one week of adding this to my cats  water  one cat was pooping pure blood and the two others were vomiting  i discontinued use <br  ><br  >it is up to us to be informed consumers  if you do not know what an ingredient is  look it up and make sure it is safe  i wish i had investigated the ingredients before i bought this <br  ><br  >here are some of the ingredients in oxyfresh pet oral hygiene solution <br  ><br  >oxygene is simply sodium chlorite acidified by citric acid to form chlorine dioxide which is a powerful antimicrobial  it appears safe <br  ><br  >zinc acetate reduces tartar buildup  it also seems safe <br  ><br  >sodium benzoate  a preservative  europe is currently fighting to have sodium benzoate banned because of the serious health problems caused by long term use  google   34 sodium benzoate europe  34  for more info  sodium benzoate easily turns into benzene  a known carcinogen  it turns into benzene when combined with vitamin c and it turns into benzene when combined with citric acid  if you look at the bottle of oxyfresh pet oral hygiene solution  you will see both sodium benzoate and citric acid are ingredients  this means that these two substances are interacting in the bottle to form benzene and we are giving our pets a known carcinogen to drink  so while my cats  mouths seem more comfortable and smell better  i do not think giving them cancer is a good trade off <br  ><br  >sodium hydroxide is basically lye  it is highly caustic and used in oven cleaners  drain openers  etc  sodium hydroxide dissolves proteins  including the soft tissue of the mouth  here is a bit of info from a government website <br  ><br  >  34 swallowing sodium hydroxide may cause severe burns in the mouth  throat and stomach  severe scarring of<br  >tissue and death may result  symptoms of eating or drinking sodium hydroxide may include bleeding  throwing up or diarrhea  a drop in blood pressure may also occur  damage may appear days after exposure   34 <br  ><br  > i believe sodium hydroxide is the ingredient that caused one of my cats to poop blood  i hope i did not give him an ulcer by making him drink this <br  ><br  >oxyfresh claims that patented oxygene is what makes their product works  if that is the case  what is all of this other crap doing in the bottle  why put caustic lye  sodium hydroxide  in the bottle  why use a dangerous preservative and call the product safe  i feel deceived e may also occur  damage may appear days after exposure   34 <br  ><br  > i believe sodium hydroxide is the ingredient that caused one of my cats to poop blood  i hope i did not give him an ulcer by making him drink this <br  ><br  >oxyfresh claims that patented oxygene is what makes their product works  if that is the case  what is all of this other crap doing in the bottle  why put caustic lye  sodium hydroxide  in the bottle  why use a dangerous preservative and call the product safe  i feel deceived 
health	i do not think i am going to be buying these online anymore because i am sick of the bug infestestations in my kitchen and now i am going to have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to rip out all the cabinets and floors  hardly worth it to save a few bucks on dog treats 
quality	i spent all this money on this bone and my dog was not interested in it  i have a 90 pound yellow lab 
quality	all of my cats do not like they taste and begrudgingly lick it off their paws 
product	i am so disappoint with this mat for several reasons  firstly i ordered a green mat and twice i received a red one  after being unable to return the mat i decided to keep the incorrect color mat  i certainly would not recommend this mat for a larger dog or a messy eater  it is not absorbent say stated and the bowls slide right off the mat
product	i like the product but am sadly disappointed in the expire date  july 2015   i ordered these in may  i had to find friends who have cats that need them to share with so they do not go bad by the time i need them  guess i know why they were so cheap  live and learn 
quality	product was stale and hard as a rock  prior to this shipment they were okay
quality	this was the first time for me using this product  my pet sitter recommended it because i have a cat that will not eat wet food  i feed it to all my cats  some liked and others didn t 
quality	not fresh  although the expiration date is more than a year away  the treats were dis colored and rock hard  i wrote to amazon and they immediately issued me credit  i think it has to do with storage 
health	this is my typical routine to de flea the house  nuke the whole house with knockout room foggers and this spray  this time  the effect was not immediate  maybe because i waited longer between treatments to do this   but sure enough  it did the trick eventually  have not seen a flea in weeks now  next time i will try to be more diligent in keeping up with treatments  highly recommend  update  the past few treatments seemed to be a bust  unfortunately  it was inevitable  it is natural selection at work  there was pretty much zero effect last time i went through my de flea routine  thankfully  whatever the exterminator used did the trick  i do not think it is a product flaw  it is just what ends up happening with all pesticides over time 
product	there is  or maybe was  an adorable camel with   34 schlep  34  on if pictured but i got some ugly purple dinosaur  that was already three months ago and i told amazon about it  they refunded the purchase and let me keep the toy   as of today  may 30   it is still the camel in the photo  i would love to buy the camel pictured as its so cute  but i cannot find it anywhere else 
quality	very poor design and construction  difficult and messy to get treats out of it by squeezing as directed  also the clip that is included is of very poor quality  skip this item 
quality	i got the thinking they were soft  my puppies were teething and they hate big  hard treats  do not know why they come up as small breads treats  did not like them at all  puppies could not eat them  money wasted 
health	my dog was able to chew some of the plastic off and wanted to eat eat  had to get rid of the toy as i was worried about her choking 
quality	i do not care for them because my dog wont eat them 
quality	these are probably fine but my dog will not eat them  she is a finicky eater    
product	not really sure  i know that i worry a bit in regard to how strong it is 
health	made my dog sick  had diarrhea and vomited a few times  please do not buy  made in china  ugh 
health	the sweet potatoes appear to be unpeeled and sliced lengthwise therefore in various sizes  there is some moisture content with the texture being somewhat like jerky  what i like  1 ingredient sourced in the usa  low calorie and high fiber what i do not like  actually it is our dogs that do not like them  also i suspect that for a dog who is a gobbler rather than a chewer they could be a choking hazard  one of ours choked on a piece of jerky not long ago so we are overly cautious  nice healthy snack but not exactly a treat at our house  we have three rhodesian ridgebacks  one spit it out and the other two finally ate them but not with gusto  rrs are notorious chow hounds so i was certainly surprised that these were not a hit 
quality	i have to order this for one of my cats and i was extremely disappointed to get the case with alot of the cans dented  i really do not like to give my cats food from dented cans and this food is very expensive to begin with  i am sure it gets thrown around in the delivery trucks so for that matter i think it should be packed better  i have heard this complaint from others 
quality	my cats would not eat it  they smelled it and walked away  i let them   34 contemplate  34  the food for two days until they were obviously not willing to eat it  howling in hunger  i went to the vet and bought a bag and poured a bowl for them   they came running and acted like they were starved  which they were it seems   i compared the bags and they seemed to look the same and the exp dates were alike  but the product was different  it was noticeably paler in color and the size of the kibble was larger  not sure what the trouble was  but i am glad that my cats were discerning enough to not eat a different product  i am reluctant to say  34  inferior  34  since i am not a cat food expert  i only know that my cats need this product to keep their digestion going smoothly  two days without eating is not conducive to intestinal regularity  i will not buy again  but cannot say the seller or producer is at fault so just one star  sorry    
quality	they felt like rubber  only one of my dogs accepted it and played with a little and did not eat it 
quality	i like this brand and will continue to support the company but this product is too hard in my opinion  it is too small to provide effective teeth and jaw exercise  so the hardness really serves no purpose and carries some risk of biting down in a way that could cause discomfort 
quality	yucky    my dog did not like at all   i was really hoping he would because i know how good salmon oil an domes are for their skin and coat  they are not fun to take out of the bag either    i will say i did appreciate the packaging    it comes in two sealable bags    likely bx the stink is so bad 
quality	my dogs like them  but again they are very hard  too hard for little dogs and very smelly  there are much better salmon treats for small dogs 
quality	kitties loved the small cans so i ordered the larger size  it is off in color and smelled weird  they would not touch it and i ended up throwing it all away 
health	this product is hazardous even when supervised  the pieces that you hide the treat under have to completely come off the device for your pet to get to the treat  i have a german shepard and she would suck that plastic right up with the treat 
product	my cat is 15 and has joint issues so really needs some glucosamine supplemented into her diet  i figured these would be meaty because they say turkey but they are basically like hard gelatin cranberry cubes so my cat showed zero interest  she would not even sniff it  total waste of money 
quality	only giving this 3 stars for now  reading reviews and info     learned that changing diet and this new food would  well         ohhhh stinky pooo lol  there cage home has gone from slightly to no smell     to making me think a herd of elephants moved in  lol  but i am hoping it goes away in a couple weeks when their little bodies make the transition  and my vet     who happens to be 1 of 26   34 actually licensed  34  exotic animal vets in the world     highly recommended it  so it cannot be bad  and they seem to like it really well 
health	these bullys did not digest well with my dogs   ie  sick  i always buy the bulls from costco and wanted to try something new  i will be going back to costco since my dogs like them better  and i am happy to not be cleaning messes 
health	with this product  i tried to approach it in a scientific manner  i knew that some of the fish would be too far gone  any time you have a person with infection  they can have severe sepsis from infection and not make  so i knew that some of the fish would be too sick to be saved  however  in the middle of the treatment as i dosed this medication  more of my fish started to show signs of disease and extensive disease with lots of ich spots  after loosing about 6 of my fish  i decided that the experiment with this medication was a failure and stopped and went to other methods and now no further ich so far  the other issue is that while using this medication  you have to turn off the skimmer and uv  that leaves the entire tank very exposed to high nutrients and pathogens  using garlic  selcon  mysis shrimp and marine max was what saves my fish  i think all can be found on amazon  after i fed these to them  i have not seen the ich  i did extensive research on all the known and theoretical methods to get rid of ich  the best is to put them in a another tank and treat but i could not do that  so i will be returning the unused bottle 
product	it is not really large  but my dog still loves it 
quality	my puppy refused to eat these  he only eats raw food  refuses to eat dry   which is fine by me  but only eats fresh raw or cooked meat for treats  he will not eat anything dry like these treats 
quality	well the ingredients read well  they are very strong smelling  looks and smell like beg       stri     and my dog turns his nose up at both and he is not picky  if you can find a sample pack somewhere recommend that before buying 
product	took a month to arrive    which was fine  i was not in any rush and things happen  then it finally arrives and every single can is damaged in some way  some even bloated from being hit or dropped so violently  i am afraid to even try the cans only dented once or twice  the ones in the best shape  in fear of making my dog ill from possible air leaks  i do not think this was due to shipping since it was secured with plastic wrap in a box 
quality	my puppy refused to eat these  he only eats raw food  refuses to eat dry   which is fine by me  but only eats fresh raw or cooked meat for treats  he will not eat anything dry like these treats 
product	they are okay and she looked forward to having them but her breath was just awful every day  i am tossing the rest of the bag despite the cost and i will not buy these again 
quality	my dog does not care for these for some reason    half the time  he does not take these and the other half of the time when he does take them  he abandons it after a few minutes of chrewing
quality	great toy if you do not mind the loud noise as your dog pushes it around the home  my dog is 20 lbs  loves to play with tennis balls  but my other small dog  15lbs  will not go near it because she does not like loud noises  the ball goes everywhere and so if it gets lost under furniture or who knows where else   it s hard to find  i still have not found it after my dog played with it  a couple of months ago   my house is not that big 1600 sq ft  i looked everywhere  the orange may be hard to find since it blends it with neutral color decor  hopefully  it will pop up one day  i like the starmark bob a lot toy better 
quality	my little dog is picky but after reading the reviews  i decided to give them a try  the result was she did not like them at all  my daughter s dog who gulps down anything will not eat them either 
product	disappointed in these  can barely find the chicken wrapped around them 
product	cheapest place to find this very expensive cat food     would not spend so much  but vet said it was important for my cat    
product	i would probably not buy one again that was not sliced open so my dog could get to the marrow easier  my lab puppy gave up on this one but another i bought  large elk antler  went over much better  i even soaked it in chicken broth  that was my experience 
product	1 star for cost  5 star for the way my dogs love them      <br  >it s hard to swallow the  7 price tag for something that costs so little to make and for such a small bag    they are probably so expensive because it is the only product that easily allows me to give my dog his medicine
product	it breaks up to easy in the can and become s dust not worth the price
quality	of all the fancy feast appetizer food i get for my cat  this one is her least favorite  she is 16 years old and does not like the big chunks  she usually licks the broth and eats the small pieces 
health	made in china  not sure what they are made of  our dog has some allergy problems since feeding him these things
health	this cat food is terrible  my cats have always been fine with any purina cat food but this makes both of my cats sick  it gives one of them diarrhea sorry tmi  and makes the other one throw up  and the worst part is that there is so much artificial yellow dye in this food that it stains terribly  we are talking bright  neon yellow    cats do not care what color their food is  so why so much fake coloring      
health	how to answer this   our cats have been eating temptaions treats for years and love them  but the last order i placed for the salmon flavor got one cat very sick  after taking him to the vet i was told not to feed any fish flavor temptations to the cats anymore  i was told too many can cause problems with some cats  now they have had the salmon flavor before without any problems but according to the mars co  that manufactures temptations they had had no complaints with the lot number i had purchased <br  >just a warning to all of you cat parents  limit the amount of treats you feed  as my vet told me only give 4 or 5 per day and no fish flavors  i am happy to say after 3 days of not eating or drinking and taking medication our cat is back to normal again  crazy as ever lol <br  >also will tell you that they are all indoor cats  we have no plants in the house and use no type of chemical to clean with that could have harmed him  the only new item to his diet was the salmon flavor temptations  look it up on the internet and you will find that people have said that these treats have caused a lot of problems in cats  even death  i hope this helps someone so they will not have to go through what our cat did 
product	i am disappointed at how thin these retriever rolls are  i have 2 great danes and they can demolish one in about 20 min  i was hoping for the  1 66 ea price they would be more significant  will not purchase again 
quality	my dog is afraid of the windy sound it makes when i squish the food out  he will not go near it  it is well made though  so one more doggy related purchase that flops 
quality	great stuff     but clearly overpriced     multiply it out yourself     my cat loves them     however per ounce price to per pound price    a rip off    i do not eat that well per pound my self       make no mistake   i love my cat    but these are way  way  over prced if you are alarmed at paying over 40 cents per ounce   6 40 per pound  measure twice     cut  buy  once as tasty as they might be they are     cereal   fat and flavoring     they are not filet mignon steak        lets get real folks      it is   34 flavored fat on grain  34  great stuff but a boondoggle
quality	my dog will eat chewing gum off the floor  he eats anything  this was the food that we had him on for ages  new batch and he will not touch the stuff  he has no problem eating  it is the food 
product	this product info seems deceptive  my dog does not handle chicken well  this product clearly states on the front of the package and in the description that there is   34 no chicken or chicken by products  34   yet  two of the first four ingredients on the back of the package list   34 chicken meal and chicken fat  34   chicken meal is rendered chicken flesh and skin 
quality	i was looking for a new line of food and treats for my cat  as i am trying to give her a more healthy diet  i thought this was a great idea for treats  wrong  she just simply will not eat them  you can leave them lying around for several hours  and she will completely ignore them  i know it is only a couple of bucks for the package  but it was truly a waste of money 
product	used it on my cats  absolutely no results like i normally get from products purchased at pet supermarket  i believe this is fake  it does not even smell the same
product	not real excited about these sticks not much chicken wrapped around them kingdom pets brand is much better 
product	my cat would not take the pill with this product  the other cat enjoyed eating them as treats only  would not buy again 
product	the cream cheese was almost impossible to get out of the tube  i actually got so frustrated i threw it away
health	my cat loves these broths  unfortunately they are very high calorie with sugar  salt and starch in the broth which is probably why she loves them  she quickly gained weight on them but because she loves them  i continue to buy them and drain most of the broth off  they would probably be great for thin or sick cats that are not eating well  my cat is a fatty so not a great choice for her  i now buy them at pet smart  they are 50 cents cheaper per packet compared to mail order 
quality	it just may be my kitten  but he did not like and would not eat them   
product	i have used atvantage in the past distant past  but changed to another brand that worked wonderful  this yr i went back to advantage as was easier to obtain  it has been like water  the fleas just started coming big time on my cat   every day falling all over my house  i had a time getting rid of the fleas   now i am going to have to purchase another expensive flea prepreation  this is so sad spending such for nothing  do not be deceived 
health	great price and thanks for free shipping  i mixed it gradually with their other food but my cats kept vomiting red stuff they could not digest so i stopped feeding them this food 
quality	it may be healthy  but my 4 cats and kittens do not like it 
health	my dog loved the taste of these  but they made her vomit  i am no longer giving them to her  too bad since she really loved them 
health	there is something about this product that does not sit well with my dog  he is ten years old and this has been his favorite treat  perhaps something has changed because now after just a couple treats  he is sick for a day out of both ends 
health	our dog broke this bone into sharp fragments in minutes  dangerous 
quality	ordered the toothpick dog treats  and got the pig ears instead  how hard is it to pull the right type of treat off the shelf  no need to return them since they are for the dogs  and they could not care less what treat i give them 
quality	my 13 month old female pomeranian will not touch it  i wasted my money  but maybe in time she will eat it  but puppy chow is the only dog food i can find she will eat  but i do not think it is as healthy for her to eat  i would love suggestions from you on how to get her to eat your dog food  she loves the joint healthcare tablets  but i had to break them in quarters because she weighs less than 10 pounds  i give her 1 4 of a tablet daily  she goes to the vet for the rest of her shots in july  so i will verify these tablets are good for her  i am not asking for a refund on the dog food since it is opened  but just want suggestions how to get my dog to eat it 
health	these chinese rawhide sticks make my dog sick  he has epilepsy like seizures  not immediately but the next day or two  every time we continued giving him the these or other dingo sticks  the seizures had returned  multiple vets did not find anything wrong with our dog so the only logical explanation is that those rawhide sticks contains some toxic chemicals that the dog reacts to <br  ><br  >update  8 2015<br  >we tried different brand savory prime and he started having seizures too  savory prime is made in china as well  who knows  it might be one foctory  but they re package it for different sellers <br  ><br  >i recommend to stay away from this poision 
health	well  it says it promotes hairball elimination and from our experience  this might be true  however  i did not expect the mechanism of elimination would be 5 or 6 piles of cat vomit daily since starting the food  hardly seems worth the price when it does not stay down long enough to be digested  we will be trying something else 
health	i have purchased these before and my dog loved them  i fed treats from the bag i just received and my pup got horrible gastrointestinitious  this led to severe vomiting and diarrhea  we ended up at the emergency vet with severe dehydration and a cost of  720 for the visit which included hospitalization  i am not sure if i got a bad batch bag but i will never buy these again  this was the only change to her diet  treats were broken up and fed sparingly  they were also refriderated after opening  her poop was dark orange which further suggests it was these treat  very disappointed 
product	it looks like it has been used  package was torn rip in some sides 
quality	my adult guinea pig will not eat it  it literally refused to have it  so i had to switch back to oxbow health products 
quality	terrible   cats would not eat them and even my dog sniffed them and walked away 
product	about 2 hours with my miniature schnauzers and pieces of the toy were coming off  i had to throw both toys in the trash  disappointed 
quality	my dog got bored with this really fast  walked away from it and sat by the treat jar instead of sitting there and figuring how to get them out  pretty sure my dog is a genius  but at least we can use this as a ball 
product	the shampoo only gave my dog relief the day of and the day after and never did get rid of the mange  i would not recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with mange find something else  will not buy again 
health	not sure why  but my dogs get sick on this bully sticks 
quality	dog loves the   34 stewart  34  brand  this seemed like better deal  he will not eat them 
product	do not trust where products are out sourced from  will not buy again
product	i did not want this because my dog is a little shi tzu  i sent this back once because the co  wanted another  3 00 for delivery  then the co  sent to me again today  i will keep it but the bones are bigger than my dog  will not buy from this co  a black horse again 
quality	oh boy these are tiny little treats that pack a huge punch  our bulldog stinks already and these make her smell like something died  might be good for dogs that do not fart but as for my dog they were a flop 
product	i would not recommend this  my dog hates it first of all  second  shipping was slow  supposed to be 2 day but took a week   third when dropped they bust into a bunch of brittle pieces  i tried to microwave like they stated to do when the pieces get small but they do not puff or anything  crazy expensive and not worth it  pass 
quality	the greenies are very dried out  they are not moist at all and they break right away and the pill falls out 
product	just not working that well  i am disappointed in the product  i am now trying flea shampoo as well as frontline to see if that helps 
product	fancy feast is a new experience for us and our old cat  learning the difference in varieties has been a challenge  so far  we have learned that he prefers the pate texture  and this type is in small chunks  he just licks off the liquid and walks away from the chunks  our future purchased will be pate  now that we know  texture is the main issue  but the salmon flavor is right for our cat  price at the time of purchase and timely delivery were good  the price has fluxuated wildly in the weeks i have been ordering this  do not know why 
product	i feel like this product is wasteful and i am not going to buy it again  you cannot really sift out the litter because the pieces are too big so you end up throwing out like three times the amount of normal litter every time you scoop 
product	14  protein not 30  formula different from picture  salt added    would not buy again  very deceptive 
product	i purchased this millet holder for my pet parakeets  it worked nicely for a month or so and by then the twine that is wrapped around wire and sticks was totally chewed up  i had discard it as it was used up  a nice concept but did not last long enough to say it was durable in any way  at least it was inexpensive and easy to replace with the old plastic slotted style 
quality	had tried the turkey from pet store and this seemed a good buy  cat s not interested in this flavor though 
health	i am giving this food two stars and that is being generous  i had been feeding this to my 1 yr old male ferret  the other will not touch it  as a snack twice a day  a couple of months ago he was admitted to the hospital for a gi foreign body  there was only food in his intestines  so we were stumped because he pooped the next day  that was an  800 bill  then i ran out of this for a couple of weeks and just recently received it and began feeding him twice a day like i was before  within a week he had diarrhea  then could not poop and was lethargic  again he had to go to the vet and this time for a laxative because his belly was so full and hard and painful  he finally pooped a rock solid ultimate ferret food poo and after that everything that was stuck in there came out too  this stuff does not dissolve in water like their regular dry food  it is gummy and play dough like  if you insist on feeding this to your ferret  may be crush them up first or only give one 
product	still has fleas  i followed the directions  purchased correct dosage for size  bad product  waste of money  go to your vet
product	i do not know for sure that itis working since it has been only 2 weeks i received them the stone seems to be smaller than i expected update   2 months into use the leather strap broke and became undone   useless also found several deer ticks on my dog
health	low odor  low odor    are you kidding me     these stink to high heaven like vomit  urine  feces   you name it  horrible  horrible  horrible  the only positive thing i will say is that the atrocious smell attracted my dog like a bear to a honeycomb <br  ><br  >however  i had to take them away from him because the permeating  noxious aroma was making the whole family nauseous  they will be going in the trash immediately 
product	waste of money  my dog never played with it  and i do not blame him  the toy is cheaply made and the yellows paws do not   34 pop out  34  they basically wobble around and fall out 
health	i recently bought this product and used it  it arrived on time  cost the same as in the pet stores  but buyers beware  this product can be hazardous to your pets  my lil dog became lethargic  could not walk  was in a lot of pain  would not eat drink and had to be rushed to the vet emergency room twice due to dehydration and vomitting 
product	these are very hard  my dogs are not enjoying them since they have the consistency of glass pieces  will not buy this particular product again 
product	the last two orders  4 boxes  did not have the added glucosomine and chondroitin as stated in description  those two ingredients is why i ordered this kind of dog treat to begin with  very disappointed 
quality	meant to order the chicken which is great  my cat is ok with this but it stinks  if i toss it to him and he does not get it right away i can smell it across the room  i hate to open it because it smells so bad 
quality	i have three cats who require lysine  these treats were my go to until now  they have changed the formula and it is now terrible    only one of my three cats will touch them now <br  ><br  >in the past  the treats have been small  dark brown  uniform in size  and sort of chewy  my cats went crazy for them  but the last package i ordered contained treats that were pale  crumbly  and not uniform in size  they looked old stale damaged  so i thought it was a bad batch and returned that package  i purchased another from a different seller and received the same thing    the second package contained the same pale powdery treats <br  ><br  >looking through the reviews and product questions  it is clear that the company has changed the formula  however  i see some people saying the pale ones are the new formula  and other people saying the dark brown ones are the new formula  for me  the pale ones are new  and they suck    i want the dark brown ones from the past  i emailed vetoquinol directly from their website to ask for clarification  but they did not bother to respond  so on top of my general dissatisfaction  i am also really underwhelmed by their customer service <br  ><br  >i m attaching a picture to show the two versions  on the left is the pale crumbly version that they seem to be selling now  if you squeeze these or try to break them  they just dissolve into powder  and the bag had a good one inch of powder in the bottom   on the right are the smaller dark brown ones that my cats have enjoyed in the past    you can see in the picture that these can be torn into smaller pieces with no crumbling <br  ><br  >since apparently it is not possible to get the small dark brown ones anymore  i am forced to find another brand  i find it really disappointing that the company would mess around like this on a product that many of us rely on to keep our cats healthy  and that we pay a premium for   25  per bag    if they had responded to my inquiry  i might feel a little less disgusted  but they didn t  and i see others posting here who tried to get answers but were also ignored  i think that stinks  just like these new treats do <br  ><br  > ps   both sellers i bought from were fine  no complaints there  this is purely an issue with the manufacturer  <br  ><br  >update  well it seems they have now settled on a new formula that is totally different from the versions i mention in this review  now the treats come in new packaging  plastic pouch with a clear front panel   and the treats are dark ish brown  super dense  and hard as a rock  my cat cannot chew them  and i cannot break them with my fingers  but i am able to cut them up with a sharp knife  the cat will then eat the small pieces  i do not know what is going on at vetoquinol  but they sure seem to be going further and further downhill  unbelievable 
product	not what it used to be  two weeks after applying treatment fleas are back along for a ride  disappointed 
health	this is absolutely the worst treat i have given so far to our beautiful pup  the day we received the item  i cut up an entire treat in half and gave it over 6 hours timeframe  max  our german shepherd puppy vomitted it out right away  and he barely ever vomits after eating a treat food <br  ><br  >i bought the largest pack available and i have had to throw away more than 90  of the pack because i do not want to ever give any of these to any dog whatsoever  oh by the way  yesterday after eating half a piece  our pup vommitted the entire treat and made a huge mess  i had to call in pro carpet cleaners to get rid of all the mark  so this ended up costing us even more     for carpet cleaning 
quality	i ordered 2 of the freeze dried treats  one container is fine  but the other has about 10 treats  the rest is crumbs   unusable except for sprinkling on the dog s food
product	not really worth  7 for the size  this is tiny and twice as much for comparable treats that offer 3x as many treats  the dogs love it  but not worth the   
quality	these came melted together   tried to use anyway  my dog turned her nose up
health	so we got this for our pit bull puppy who loves to chew  he loved it to death in a few minutes he had   34 killed  34  the toy and it was coming apart in large plastic pieces  i got it away from him right away  as some other reviewers said this is not a chew toy as the dog could choke <br  ><br  >love the sound it makes though 
product	my cat really likes it but it made him fat  i cannot say the ingredients are too great  either  i would not buy it again 
product	got this for my chihuahuas  theyvdont like it at all   they love liver but they did not even give this a sniff or a glance  even worse the product arrived less than half in such a large container  so disappointed 
product	loved the kibble s shape which made it much easier for meatball  my one year old short haired persian  to pick up  however  that is where the praise stops  i switched to this food because i would heard it was high quality  i liked the kibble shape  and there were tons of positive reviews  however    i think the person who recently mentioned that royal canin has changed their ingredients must be right  i switched to this food meatball has thrown up 2 4 times a week since switching to this food  he is one year old  otherwise totally healthy  and had no issues before  i asked my vet what the deal might be  she said it could have to do with a low protein content in the food  before royal canin  i was feeding him purina one smart blend  the first ingredient there is real chicken turkey  and it has 37 5  protein  royal canin s first ingredient is chicken by product meal and has a protein analysis of 28     why would anybody pay  32 for a 7 pound bag of inferior food when you can have the other for  22 for a 16 pound bag     it blows my mind  i am so annoyed with myself for falling into the   34 only the best for my pet   34  mentality without actually doing the simple work of looking at the ingredients 
quality	my cats do not like the flavors  well they do not eat them  i am assuming they do not like the taste and or smell 
product	the so called everlasting ball did not last more than a few treat times for my little dog  she chewed through the fingers that are supposed to keep her from getting at the treats inside the ball  rendering the chew ball useless <br  >i would not recommend this to any dog that likes to chew   
product	a bit smaller than i expected  wish it was not made in china 
quality	maybe it is just my picky bunny  but he will not even go near these  normally he loves apple  and he will munch his timothy hay  but these he is literally tossed aside  so  these have gone to waste   \
product	so bad  the ambers broke and can apart  got a refunded after i returned it after using it for three days
health	bought as part of a 4 box order  this was the first time my cats had eaten this one  i thought it would be good for all of them since it is good for the urinary tract health and seemed like that would be good for prevention of any future problems  i have 3 cats  2 females and 1 male  and they have only had it twice so far  the first time one ate a good amount but not all  one ate half and left the rest and the 3rd one hardly ate it at all   the last two ended up getting sick shortly after eating it  but maybe it was too rich or something for their stomachs   today i tried it again   they all ate different amounts of it and did not get sick  will wait and try it again in a few days and see how they do  i do not see why it would not be good for them but since none of them have urinary track problems  i will drop it if they do not do well on it 
quality	we purchased these a few times in different flavors as our dogs always need to be taking some sort of prescriptions for some dog on reason or another  the four legged kids like them at first but tire of them quickly  we purchased a multi  pack and there have been a couple of bags that were completely dried out and the dogs would not touch them and they were thrown out 
product	lid does not fit well and they arrived with some having spilled into the box they were packaged in  even though they taped the lid on  dogs are not crazy about the taste  they walk away from them  but eventually eat them  they get other treats they love so i understand why they walk away from these  if they did not get any other treats  then they would probably eat these 
health	my 2 cats seem to be much thirstier with this brand than with hill s  also my orange tabby s fur has lost its smooth  shiny coat  i do not plan to buy this brand again  there has also been some vomiting  which had not occurred before  the ingredients in the list seemed to be fine  but it does not seem to agree with my cats 
health	my cat still had throwing up issues with this cat food because of the grain
quality	i almost have to force my cats to eat this  one will  reluctantly  after much coaching  and would not eat two in a row   and they are very small  the other smells it  might lick it  but will not put it in her mouth  as a   34 treat  34   these are useless 
quality	my dog loves the zukes mini treats but will not eat these  they have a strong rosemary smell  they are a great treat size though 
quality	in every package of this shipment at least 3 4 of the pill pockets were dried out and crumbled when i tried to wrap them around pills  could not understand why there were a few moist pockets that worked fine in packages that seemed old even though use by dates were fine 
product	nice price and size but taste i guess it is ok   my cats do not really care for it  i recommend buying small bag if it is your cats first time trying cat food 
quality	old product  dog will not eat them  hoped i was saving money  but very disappointed in the quality of product  stale and it is her favorite treat 
quality	these treats are my dogs favorite  but she will not eat them  they are hard and must be stale because she attempted to eat one and it is old  she turns her nose up to them  i brought two boxes of 150 each and it is just wasted  i did order the ears and they must be fresher because she will eat these 
quality	i do not like this new recipe  now the strips have added corn molasses that bind the materials together but gives the strips a denser consistency  the strips are easier to bend in half now when sharing among dogs  but i preferred the older jerky better  this feels more watered down  my dogs really do not need sweetened treats  even though they ate these gleefully  this is a great cost saving move on the company s part  but i will not be buying these in the future 
product	i love this product  however  i live on a 3rd floor  the main reason i order like this is for the perk of having this heavy supply delivered to my door  i work from home  so i am home all the time and only once out of this past year have i had the luxury of not having to 1  physically go to my apartment office and 2  lug this box up my 3 flights of stairs  oh  and i am 4 11  34   super disappointing 
quality	my dog is not a picky eater but would not eat these 
quality	well i rate it 1 star simply due to the reaction from my kitties  they just do not like it  however  i am sure if that is all i fed them they would eat it  maybe i will try that 
quality	probably the worst response i have seen to new dog food  picky eater will not touch it  dog that eats everything  including cardboard  will not touch it  friend s dog will not touch it  tried to be sneaky and mix it in a bowl with other food  the dogs ate the other food and left these bits of kibble in the bowl 
quality	my dogs actually turned their noses up at these  the ones at target are better 
quality	they look good but my 2 little dogs  a poodle and a terrier will not eat them  they are picky eaters and the only biscuit they like are the pedigree breath freshers 
quality	{update} 8 24 15  what a shock    what arrived is absolutely nothing like my previous 2 orders  it is like little cubes of processed turkey vs actually turkey  they completely shatter and disintegrate in my hands when i try to break them into smaller pieces  i am attaching a photo  in the photo  above is the bag containing the new order and below are dehydrated pieces from the previous orders  such a disappointment    this just went from 5 stars to 1    <br  >3 20 15   5 1 15  this freeze dried turkey is a massive hit with both my cat and dog  at first my cat was not interested  but then i   34 hydrated  34  the pieces and he went crazy  eventually he started eating the dehydrated pieces <br  >caution  hydrated your cat may try to rip the skin off your hand getting to it   
product	i am very disappointed with this product   the food is darker than usual and has a strange smell  i love the convenience of the food arriving straight to my door but overall the product has been disappointing on several occasions   this being the worst  from now on i am just going to go to the pet store for something as important as food for my dog instead of trusting what i am getting through the mail from different vendors 
product	my dog loves the taste  and it works well in her kong  but the reason for my low rating is the price   way too expensive to keep purchasing over and over again  will probably end up just using regular peanut butter 
quality	the formula changed and i did not know it when i purchased another 25lb bag of this food  it now includes large  brightly colored green and blue pieces that are basically treats  my rabbit is now acting like a drug addict since this change has been made and has become loud and destructive once he finishes his dish until i give him more  what a nightmare  now i have to find another pellet to give and hope he gets over it  these used to be perfect  i am so disappointed and worst of all  i have to throw away 25lbs of this stuff 
product	my dog just loves these and they are a great treat for her because they are low calorie  i have seen them cheaper  but unfortunately  i can no longer find them near us  since she loves them so much  it is worth it to me  a plus is that they are usually delivered before the estimated delivery date 
health	cat seemed to have an allercic reaction where it was applied  lost all hair in location and even seemed yo eat thru skin  leaving open wound where you could see blood  this has happened with two cats  will not use again  beware of this product 
product	only 2 of my 3 cats liked them  one would not even try them  its also a very small package with little product for the price 
product	my dog loves them  but they arrived with the chips crushed in a thousand pieces  i probably will not order them again 
health	my golden retriever is a service dog who is usually not a heavy chewer  on receipt of this ball  however  within 10 minutes of supervised play  she chewed a small hole in it  we saw it immediately  and removed it from her reach before it went further  i am hoping any pieces she may have eaten are not harmful 
quality	i wish i would have gotten the smaller version of this toy  this 5  34  is a bit big for my dachshund  the thing i do not like about it is that i do not know how i am going to clean the inside 
product	the edible center piece fell out as i opened the package and it would not even come close to  snapping  or staying in the bone  still gave the nylabone to the dog but the whole reason we got this was for the treat she would have to work for  the treat ended up going down the hatch in 2 seconds  very disappointing and disappointed 
product	my dog loved it  but it it got moldy within a couple of weeks  not sure if it said on the bag to keep in frig  i was disappointed in the fact that over half of it was wasted 
quality	the pills are much harder than other brands  they are not very pliable  making it difficult to seal the top  or squeeze it open in order to stuff the pills inside  in my opinion they are too big for a small dog  also  my picky jrt would not eat the bacon flavored ones  they might work for your dog  but i am returning them 
health	way too easy for my dog and dangerously small parts that could be a choking hazard  i wont be using this product
health	after receiving the bag i was disappointed to find the chicken strips were made in china posing a danger to my dog 
product	i was very disappointed with this order  when i purchase these treats from my vets office they are very soft and pliable  i use them to put my pups pills in  these just crumble into little dry pieces when you try to place a pill in them  i will never purchase them from this site again 
quality	he loves the classic  but does not like the creamy   i have no clue why 
health	these items make my dogs sick  my vet  tells me to not give anything to my dogs to eat that is made in china  these items are made in china so i am returning them 
quality	just too hard     small dogs unable to chew on it much at all 
quality	this item is difficult to review  i hope you  the reader  understands that i did not purchase this product for myself  i bought this product for my puppy   he is a 16 week old yellow labrador retriever  i wish he could speak and rate this item himself but i am left to interpret <br  ><br  >what you ve heard is true  a lab puppy will try to eat and chew just about anything  our vet recommended getting him the   34 biggest bone possible  34   we want to keep our puppy satiated  happy  and  above all else  healthy  before having a dog  i had no idea rawhide bones were so disgusting  held together by various adhesives  i do not know anyone who would eat glue so why would they give it to their pet <br  ><br  >after some research i found antlers  long lasting  healthy alternatives to those sticky  awful rawhide bones  the reviews i read of this specific item were great   while the cost was on the expensive side  i was willing to pay the price for a chew toy that could keep my pup happy for weeks <br  ><br  >why did i only give this item three stars  i love the idea  it is healthy  no glue   it is natural  picked from another animal   and many other people say it takes their dogs forever to eat  unfortunately  my pup does not seem to agree  like most dogs  he was curious at first   i gave it to him in the kitchen and he picked it up and carried it in to the living room  he gnawed on it for roughly 5 minutes and then walked away  i have tried over the past three days to get him interested but he does not want anything to do with either of the two pieces that came in the package <br  ><br  >i have read that some dogs reject antlers because it is simply   34 not the right one  34   perhaps that is the case  perhaps my pup would find another one more suitable  with that said  i cannot afford to buy him multiple packs with the hopes that he will enjoy one of them <br  ><br  >this product is worth a try  like all things   your dog may love it or your dog may hate it  if he loves it it s worth the money  if he hates it  at least you tried and you did your job as a pet owner to find something healthy for your pet to enjoy 
quality	i have a pitbull and he rips everything to shreds and is always bored and i thought this would be good for him and he would love it and he would rip it to shreds like he does my medicine bottles but he did a good job on it but i guess it was taking too long and he got bored with it real quick and will not play with it  so it is somewhere stuck with treats in it  if he cannot tear it up he do not like it  if it made noise he would still be playing with it 
product	these are a good price  but only one of our dogs will eat them  unfortunately  that dog is not the one who has anxiety issues  so   i cannot really say if the calming part works   but i have to say that only 1 of our dogs will actually eat the treats 
quality	my dogs did not like them  not any of my 6 dogs  even my pig dog would not eat them 
quality	after purchasing these several times in the past  this latest order has gone moldy  a week after opening the package  has never happened before  my dog will not eat them  not sure what is different this time  any others having problems with this product 
quality	this product arrived as normal but this time one of the cans was damaged  obviously been this way for a while as was full of magots and smelled really bad  not to mention the stinky liquid that leaked all over my carpets  thinking maybe a trip to the pet store to purchase cat food in future
product	we have 3 large dogs and they all enjoy the flavor of these treats and gobble them up  one of the dogs has a sensitivity to potatoes  it only takes a small piece of this treat to trigger a reaction  the package states 80  percent beef  i would tend to think the other 20 percent is significantly potato <br  ><br  >at  9 99 per bag  7 5 ounces   that would be roughly  20 bucks a pound for meat and potatoes  for 20 bucks a pound  amazon offers many 100  all meat natural beef treats  made in the usa  not only are they 100  beef  but the beef is usually identified as to exactly what part of the cow it is 
health	these are mostly small and some are only partial pieces  they could present a choking hazard  the package did not contain 10 full chews  other suppliers i have purchased from had better quality control  larger and more consistently sized  i will not buy these again 
quality	for some reason they were dried out  checked pkg  all over could not find any openings and the date was good  did they repackage some they did not sell into a newly dated pkg 
product	i really should have read the reviews before purchasing this item  i have learned my lesson  i now have 6 packages of 30 pill pockets that are so dry i cannot even get them to mold around the pills  not sure if i will try again through amazon even though the return process was painless 
quality	cockatiel would not even touch it  it does not like it     even after i crushed it cockatiel barely ate it  it does not even smell nice to me as a human  i wonder if other reviews are fake 
health	not sure about this product as my dogs  yorkies  threw up after eating these  they also did not have a long shelf life  they got moldy quick 
product	great low carb treat for diabetic cats  they were not in treat sizes though   some sections over 2  34  in length  and when you try to break them up they get crushed and powdery so much of the texture is lost  thought pure bites were better  my meow liked the flavor though 
quality	this review is only for this product as ordered through amazon  which i do not recommend doing  <br  ><br  >i ordered the large bag and it arrived with all the treats in pulvarized tiny pieces  i did not even open the bag but you can tell through the bag the pieces are also all dried out  i have ordered these before directly from the company and they arrived fresh  not all broken up  and my dog loves them  it is really too bad but i cannot recommend ordering from here  many of the pieces are so tiny they are almost powder and i question the freshness   maybe it has something to do with how they are stored  anyhow  give these a pass 
quality	what dog does not love greenies  however with this box that i recently received  i noticed that the greenies were extra flexible and a faded green  i checked the sale by date and it is far off  so they do not seem to be old  i checked if they have recently been recalled  but i have not heard of anything in the news  i also gave my dog a couple before i realized they were an odd color  and he has been okay  i am not sure what happened to this batch    but now i am stuck with this giant box of odd greenies  see photo for color of the greenies 
product	i have ordered this product many times before  my dogs have loved it and i have been so happy with it  this time i opened the package to find a very small chew  that was green in color  i double checked the packaging and it stated it was a medium size  filet mignon treat  either the coloring and size have drastically changed   to the not so favorable  or  somehow there was a mix up in the plant  so very disappointed
product	did not really interest my dog  he chewed on them for about 5 minutes  then left them alone
health	my cat tried to throw up 3 minutes after eating this  she only ate a couple  the pellets are too hard and a lot of cats do not chew their food all the way  be caution 
quality	the hay ball is empty    not eaten  on the floor of the cage  within hours
quality	my cat loved to eat friskies chicken shreds in gravy while living in japan  so i ordered the same food when we moved her to the us  however  she refused to eat this food  she took one sniff and walked away  even though she was very hungry  my dog would not touch it either  on close examination  the shreds look very different  the food in japan was clearly shredded pieces of chicken breast  but the food here in the us looks like formed rectangles of some unidentifiable material  the quality of the food seems to be much inferior to the friskies sold in japan 
health	unfortunately  our cat developed diarrhea   he is back on his prior hills science formula for young cats  and is ok<br  >ltg      bryn mawr  pa 4 22 15
health	this kibble looks and smells different than the previous bags i have bought over the past 3 4 years  they changed the formula  what ever they did  my dog does not like it anymore  a few days after starting the new bag  my dog started wretching  the third day she vomited  i threw the food out   she is on a different brand and is doing awesome  no more tummy troubles 
quality	good value for my large parrots  they do have mealy moths in some of the bags but that happens with this type of product  i guess <br  ><br  >update 8 2 17   i have lowered the rating for several reasons <br  >   the volume of the food in these 8 pound bags has decreased by about 20  over the past year   i have not weighed them <br  >   there were only one biscuit in one bag and 2 in the other bag i purchased this time  this is not acceptable  it is down from 15 or so per bag <br  >   there was only one peanut in one bag and none in the other  this is not acceptable  it is down from 15 or so per bag <br  ><br  >i have been purchasing this product for many years for my two parrots that are over 40 years old  i have been observing the shrinking size and change of content for years and my birds do not like the changes any more than i do 
quality	my cat is used to fresh food and i thought he would like these since they seem to just be dried pieces of chicken  he will not eat this  i have no idea why  maybe they are not just dried chicken 
quality	it is been weeks and my bunny does not care for it  it is likely just her and not the product 
quality	my cat thought it was stupid   <br  ><br  >but that is no fault of the manufacturer  my cat also does not like cat treats  it seems the product is great and i have a defective cat 
quality	boy when this thing rolls across a floor it is loud  so be ready for that  my issue is that it is actually too hard to get the treats out  my dog is not able to do it without help and he solves other puzzles too quickly and easily  maybe the hole on the outside could be a little bigger at least so if you wanted to use the double chamber to rachet up the difficulty you could  not bad overall though  it stands up to a beating 
health	these treats made my dog sick to her stomach  i am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the treats  just that they did not agree with my dog 
product	bags are more expensive than the leash  flashlight broke after 1 month of use 
quality	poor quality  my birds pretty much picked on it and broke the whole thing  
product	so so    the top few are in one piece but as you get to the middle of the bag  they are all crushed   my dog loves them  but i feel that 1 2 the bag is wasted   they are not cheap   
product	this stuff seems to make my dog lethargic the day after i apply it and it only lasts about 3 weeks  i have never seen it kill a tick because i can sometimes still find a big fat tick that has obviously been there long enough to die if it was going to <br  >and at about  1 00 a drop  it is overpriced for the poor job it does
quality	while i love the ingredients  my dog refused to eat them  i tried to give them to k 9s at work and they would not take them either  a treat and company can have the best ingredients in the world  but if dogs will not eat them it defeats the purpose 
product	you get what you pay for  every can dented  i also noticed the product has not been the same since it was sold to a huge company  i have switched to a much better product for my furry babies 
quality	i gave it three stars because my cats just do not like them and i have found that most people read the middle of the road answers as they tend to be the most honest  others may love tem but they can not work if your pet will not eat them  this is not a reflection of how the product works 
health	the cats liked it but this is not good for cats with very sensitive stomachs  had to stop feeding it to them 
quality	my cat s would not eat it even blended with canned food
health	i do not know if it is because we bought it online  but ever since receiving this dog food my dogs have had diarrhea  i have been buying this food at petco for over a year and no problem 
quality	i actually like these treats because they made with peanut products  oatmeal  and chicken meal  my dogs  hate these treats  these are small bites   about the size of a nickel  maybe a bit smaller and they are very crunchy  watching my six dogs eat these  i was struck by the fact that they seemed to be doing an awful lot of chewing for very little reward  they second day that i offered these as a   34 coming in when called  34  treat  three of the six dogs turned them down  day three   none of my dogs want these  these are rhodesian ridgebacks  they will eat anything and they love peanut butter flavor  my heathens would eat a peanut butter covered stick  they will not eat the nutro crunchy treats with peanut butter though 
quality	these are too big and too hard for a puppy   i am sure a larger dog would love them  
health	very expensive biscuit is what it essentially is  i am lucky i did not have to deal with vomiting or taking my dog to the vet but after reading some of these reviews i had to monitor him all day to make sure he was not getting sick  this bone caused him to have diarrhea so   34 edible  34  is completely debatable  i would never give this to my dog had i seen the other reviews  i do not recommend it as there are so many better things you can give as a treat and as a chew it lasted my 50lb shepherd 10 minutes of chewing time 
product	i was disappointed  looked like a larger bag  the price was way too much for the small bag i received  i could of purchased the same bag about  10 cheaper 
product	my dog absolutely loves this  but he eats it too fast  i got the x large for my 40lb keeshond  i had to take it away or he would have eaten it all in about 45 minutes  i let him eat about 1 3 of it and put it away for another day  so we got 3 15 minutes sessions of entertainment  kind of expensive if you ask me 
quality	i had kept an empty package with a note written on it to re order because my dog liked these  however  what i received was a different item with the words   34 new   improved formula  34 shown printed in yellow over the green trees on the package  not shown in the picture    the texture is totally different and not enjoyable for my dog  they have added vegetable glycerin  guar gum  gelatin  they have removed the zinc  protein has changed from 30  to 14   i am very disappointed   not to mention my dog is certainly not too excited about eating these  i feel as though amazon has misled buyers by showing a picture of a product they are not sending us and also for not pointing out they were selling a changed formula 
quality	our parakeet would not eat these  the pellets are too large for him to identify as food  and he is less than a year old  and too hard for him to break with his beak easily  when i mashed them up he would eat them out of my hand  but that is all 
quality	i bought this for my chinchillas  i gave it 3 stars only because my little guys would not eat them  i do not think it is necessarily a bad product  it is just not something i will buy again since they do not like them  other small pets may like them  just not mine   
product	there were still fleas on my car after two doses in the same month  i would not buy again
health	not a lot of beef  mostly liver  liver is chewy and tough  we use a meat tenderizing mallot  flat side  smooshing the liver so my furry babies will not choke on it  chopping it is not enough and without mashing the liver  it is way too tough and chewy  it is not their favorite and i only feed it to them when they are tired of everything else 
product	puppy loves these  but they stick to his teeth  very strong odor so have to wash coat sweater pants immediately after otherwise i can smell it on the next wear  great for during training classes as they are soft and easily consumed  but stickiness and smell make it something i will not buy again 
quality	my cat loves the chicken and beef varieties but will not touch the salmon  so it goes    
quality	i am disappointed as this is such a great product  but my dog does not like it and i cannot coerce her to eat it  that is why i gave it a three  if she ate it it go up to 5 
health	both of my 100  pound golden retriever s choked on this product  i have never had any issues with them choking on anything until i received this product  i will continue to order busy bone rollhides and busy bones are great  products but never this one again 
product	will serve purpose  barely  at 5 2  tall and 100 lbs  the around the waist strap is too huge… so that aspect will not work for me  the pockets other than the treat pocket are so small that they do not really even hold a waste bag  i will keep the pack because to return it would be more than it is worth but it is not what i expected  thank you 
quality	this was the food my breeder was serving my new puppy and it left him with stinky breath and poops  we changed to peticurean food and we are much more satisfied with our dogs breath and overall health 
product	way too expensive  my dog ate one in less than a minute  he did like it though 
quality	terrible smell  my furry friend will not even go near it 
quality	my dogs loved loved loved the venison and sweet potato  past tense only because i stopped purchasing this because my dogs stunk from eating it  breath was awful  stink oozed from everywhere  i could not take it anymore and switched to the lamb and veg  natural balance is great for my pets  just could not handle the pungent odor of my dogs  they will be on lamb and veg since we love the natural ingredients without the stink 
product	terrible  the package was not sealed and the liquid is normally clear  when i received it  the liquid was yellow with strange particles floating around  thank god i did not put this in my fish tank 
quality	not many sticks for the price  they have no smell so two of my dogs will not even touch them  i will not be buying them again i am afraid 
product	i am not really sure how this dog food could have anything more then 2 3 stars overall  for me it gets 1 and that is because there is no zero stars <br  >like others have mentioned the product was delivered damaged  one of the cans was busted all the way through  mold and rotten dog food covered the far edge of the box it was shipped in  i would say at least 40  of the cans were dented  i had to throw out 2 cans and wash off the others  that is just problems with shipping and or storing the product though  as far as the the food goes  it is absolutely gross  the smell is awful and it is quite soupy  my french bulldog hates it and he will just about eat anything  he would only eat about 25 30  of his dinner  after 3 days of this i felt like i was starving or maybe torturing the poor thing  so i packed the rest of it up and gave it to a friend to give to her dogs  now i am feeling kinda guilty for doing such a mean thing to my friends dogs <br  >my advice to anyone looking for a good wet food for their puppy is to keep looking  do not waste your money on this one 
product	i love the pill pockets for capsules   large pills but the chicken flavored pill pockets seem to crumble a lot more than the hickory flavored ones  or the beef ones when you can get them   i really prefer the beef flavored   hickory smoked flavored pill pockets over the chicken flavored ones  with crumbling  its more difficult to get large pills capsules in them  i have a 120 pound shepherd mix   he gets large pills twice a day  i ordered 12 packages of the chicken flavored   will probably be returning the unopened packages 
product	ok but my dog did not really like them  he is a finicky eater 
product	this stuff is useless <br  ><br  >it used to work  back in the advantage i days  but the advantage ii will maybe make the cat stop itching for a day or two  then the fleas are back a week after the treatment <br  ><br  >i started treating her every two weeks  the normal schedule is monthly  but never got more than passing relief for a week or so  i have moved on to revolution  which seems to work much better and takes care of fleas in the environment  as well 
product	when i opened this package  the treats smelled rancid  but maybe that is just how they are meant to be  our golden retriever puppy liked them all right  but likes other treats such as lamb puffs and bacon flavored botanic training rewards much better 
quality	my dogs will not even touch these treats so i gave to my neighbors dogs and they won  34 t even eat them     totally wasted my money   
product	followed directions exactly as stated  needed a full bottle for one area approx 12  34 x 72  34   got rid of about 75  of the smell of cat urine  i may order another bottle for a different area to try again  very expensive stuff though  considering it needs so much per spot 
health	i had very high hopes for this product as i have a lab who is a chewer  she got the ball out in about 15 minutes and then broken it into small pieces about 5 min after  the rubber this comes in seems dangerous to me as a dog could get it lodged in their throat  this is a waste of money and a kong toy or rawhide bone is better suited 
quality	we did not care for these as a treat for our dog as they were greasy  they also fall apart easily 
quality	food is fine but one can was dented in shipping and the seal broken  by the time we found it buried in the case  things were pretty stinky 
product	these seem to be good    the dogs love them and it states that they are all natural    i pray that they are  at least the price is also reasonable    everyone seems to be about ripping people off anymore  update    when i first purchased these i was paying allot less    most people are not rich enough to pay almost 20 00 bucks for dog treats   rip off 
health	my kitty throws these treats up every time i give them to her  so i am going to have to give them to a friend whose kitty may be able to eat them  i cannot fault this product because my kitty has developed a very sensitive stomach and i have to buy prescription food from the vet for her  prior to her problem developing  i am sure i would rate as a five star product 
product	i bought this flavor hoping my dog would like it better than the   34 conventional  34  flavors like chicken or salmon  but he actually seems to like this rabbit flavor less than the salmon  not worth the extra money for fancy flavor 
health	i was ordering 2   3 bags of these treats weekly for my dogs for the past year  my one dog has severe allergies to so many ingredients that these used to be perfect as they only had the one ingredient listed   rabbit  now  4 7 15   i received my recent order and the packaging has changed  whenever the packaging changes  it scares me because that usually means something with the ingredients changed as well  and i was right  now they have corn starch and vegetable glycerin listed in the ingredients as well  my dog is allergic to corn  we will no longer be purchasing these dog treats 
product	dog liked them but i will not buy again  too brittle for my small dog  the sharp edges made me nervous 
product	the leash lasted half of a walk  the concept is amazing  but the bowl fell into two pieces when i opened it  easily fixable with glue  sadly though  the leash kept tangling and after untangling three times on the first walk  the button which controls the length of the leash broke  i contacted customer service with this information but have not had a response or been issued a refund  even though the broken leash was returned  pretty disappointed since this would have been an awesome leash for outdoor adventures 
product	they say it is 10 bones  but check your package  i only received 8  very disappointed  these are small bones and not cheap  my dog loves them  but i probably will not buy them again  especially with not getting the entire product i ordered 
health	the pellets are a little too big and hard so my 40lb husky only gives in and starts eating once she is starving  she just turned 1 year old and really seems to have to put a lot of effort into crushing them with her teeth  so she prefers to go hungry as long as possible before eating this  in terms of not getting my dog sick this seems to be quality food  but for apparently not being very chewable or appetizing i can only give it 3 stars <br  ><br  >note that i have also tried the adult food and it is the same problem  but those pieces are even larger so it just makes the problem worse 
health	these things made my dog sick    at first they were really great  but then the second bulk package i bought on amazon made her really sick  she was lazy  lost appetite  and nothing in her diet changed  her poop was green and runny and then i stopped giving her greenies and she was better again  not sure what is wrong with the second batch of greenies  i have read other reviews online noting that these can make your dog really sick so dog lovers be careful 
quality	my dogs did not care for this product  so  i was left with a bunch     i put them in my doggies  food so they would not notice 
quality	my dogs loved it at first  apparently it tasted really good  then  after about a year on it  my poodle started puking  sleeping constantly and having more seizures than usual  he s old and he does that now   my other little dog started acting really tired for him and puked a couple times before he started refusing to eat it  i did my research and found that dogs have died from eating this food  nutritionally speaking  this stuff is awful  it tastes good to them but it is kind of like feeding your kids mcdonalds every day  they will love it at first and signs might not show up immediately but in the long run you will see that you ve shortened your dog s lifespan by at least a few years and  at worst  killed them  when i got a healthier food for my dogs they scarfed it down  i tried to do what they recommend when you are transitioning dogs from one food to another and mix the two foods at first to help them adjust  my little dog actually picked individual pieces of the new food out of his bowl to eat and left a little pile of this food behind  he is a smart little dog  i think we should listen to him 
health	did not work for my shar pei  in the products defense though  he had a very resistant ear infection 
product	i did not realize what big bags these came in until they got here  there is a lot of air in the treats so that is probably why  they are kind of like those tiny saltine crackers you give to toddlers  they are baked like goldfish  my dogs like them but then they like just about all treats  they do not   34 love  34  them  if you look into the nutrition of these you will find that they are not good for your dogs but they are not bad for them either  they are the dog version of   34 empty carbs  34   they are small treats though so they work really well for training 
quality	i like that the outside is soft  do not have to worry about it hurting anything when tossed around  but filling it is not super easy  and it barely holds a cup of kibble despite it being a large ball  seems like it is really easy to get all the food out quick too  have had it for a month or so with a rambunctious lab  she normally chews on the treat dispensing toys  but she has not on this one  not sure if she is just not interested or if it is because the treats come out so easy that she is done with it quick  so  no real test of strength on the toy  she is thrown it around and nothing has come loose or broken  so that is good so far 
health	my dog has been very sensitive to this new bag of food  i contacted my vet due to his stomach upset and diarrhea  i googled this and others seem to be having the same issue with this latest lot of food 
health	the red pieces are all over the house  the dog likes them but i think they made her a little sick  she started to not feel good the day after chewing on one 
health	i have no doubt these are delicious  the problem is that they are hard and slick    just like plastic  i give one to my 60 pound dog and she chokes  i cannot break them  i cannot bend them  unless i plan on soaking them in water and feeding just as soggy  i would never feed these to my dog  plastic choking chips 
product	this is not as described and it is a totally different package  the one the was sent treats 5 gallons per tablet  it is described as one tablet per 10 gallons  buyer beware 
product	it is on the wetter side of wet foods with a pureed consistency  my dog quickly tires of this flavor and i can only sneak it in a couple times a week  the can requires a can opener  it is one of the least expensive veterinary recommended wet foods i have come across  customer service has been excellent  with speedy deliver and quick replacement of damaged cans 
quality	dogs does not like the spray  should have bought the gel
quality	my dog first turned his nose up at these  but i left some on the floor for him  he eventually ate them  and my fussy dog usually will not eat any store dog treats  he is very fussy  he seemed to prefer the lamb  though he ate both the lamb and the venison  i just think these are too expensive for what you get  i usually make my own for family  friends and neighbors 
product	i had been buying the purebites treats at the pet store for a while  and the both the dogs and cats love them  when i saw how much cheaper per ounce this product was from amazon  i jumped at the chance to get thus larger bag  big mistake   it was obvious the bag had been mishandled before packaging as it was mostly just dust and some very small pieces  if you look through the reviews  you will see i am not the only one who has had this problem  if they are going to sell this item  they need to figure out a way to handle and ship it without grinding the treats to dust 
product	it takes longer for me to put this in the toy than it does for my dog to eat this  that actually is not completely true but after giving this to my large breed dog a few times he definitely has a method to eating these  he now manages to actually pop out the treat and finishes it off within five minutes of giving it to him  i am not saying that it is not a good treat every once in a while and at least it keeps my dog busy for a few minutes  but between the expensive price of the toy and occasionally buying refills the price adds up  at least buying these off of amazon and adding it to an existing purchase is quite a bit cheaper than going to a pet store 
product	they were almost small size threats  not vene for medium doga  for the price and the s h was not worth it
health	i hate to have to give this a negative review  i usually love zuke s treats  and the skinny bakes and the mini naturals are great for my dog  these however ended up being a waste of 12 bucks i could have used on something else  my dog is within the 10 25 pound size range suggested on the bag  so i thought they would be an appropriate size for my dog  they are much too small for him however  and he cannot grip them well enough to chew on them so they pose a choking risk  perhaps a larger size would have worked better for him  but the one suggested on the package will not work for him at all and i probably cannot return an opened package 
health	i have 2 older cats  1 of which has a sensitive stomach  i thought this might be just the answer as i switched them from canned food to dry  one bag of this and they both put on a lot of weight  my huge male with the sensitive stomach went from a good body weight of 14 lbs to 22 lbs  i do still order this on 3 month subscription for my niece has found it perfect for her 1 year old cat which also has a sensitive stomach  1 star from me  two stars for it having a use somewhere away from these two of mine 
health	my review is mixed at this time  i will evaluate it again this summer and update  last summer fall my 80 lb lab was infested with ticks after a hike in the woods  i think we disturbed a tick nest  even after we removed all the ticks he would still get ticks occasionally through out the season  if he gets one more tick  i will downgrade this review to a 1 and buy another brand
product	salmon treats are great and my cats love them but the treats are all crushed in the bottom third of package  when i ordered from private distributor this never happened  wonder how being stored
product	i ordered these chew sticks for my dog very excited to find that they were made in the usa   finally  the reviews seemed promising and i was excited when i received the product  however  after opening the package i found a huge  thick long black hair wrapped around the first chew<br  >stick i pulled out of the vacuumed sealed bag     it was disgusting    within the box with the product  there was a letter from the maker owner of this product with his email saying to send feedback questions  etc  right away  i sent him an email and attached pictures of the hair around the product  i asked for either a refund or a new bag of clean chew sticks for my dog and stated how they truly need to have better quality assurance when packaging their product  it is now been over two months since i sent that email and still no reply  i gave the owner ample time and am completely disappointed in the terrible lack of customer service and quality of this product  gross   never will order again 
quality	first of all  this ball is way too small to be considered a   34 large  34  size  it might be okay for a small to medium sized dog  but is too small for anything weighing over 50 pounds  my dog would not touch the thing  and i think part of the reason is because there is an overly pungent vanilla odor coming off the plastic  also  the plastic on the inside of the hole was not cut right  and did not allow the food to drop out of the ball without an extreme amount of effort 
product	all the cookies were broken when they got here  it was a very expensive mess 
product	does not really work  even my vet has told me not to order frontline anymore  the best thing to order would be the edible flea treatment treat 
health	absolute worst smelling bully sticks ever      i know they stink  but i almost threw up  get them somewhere else 
product	a bit pricey  all my dog liked was the chicken wrapped around the sweet potato  murphy is very picky
health	i liked the product  my dogs however did not  gave both of my yorkies a bone when they came in  and woke up the next morning to vomit all over my floors    they love the plastic nyla bones i got them so i figured these would be a score   little let<br  >down it upset their stomach 
health	arrived on time and seems to be fresh  made my pomeranian s hair fall out in clumps he may be allergic  i have read of dogs becoming sick and dying after being fed this so i wont be buying anymore  i threw half the bag away 
quality	deal great  treat not so great   <br  >we buy the beef version for our two dogs and they are a hit   <br  >received these by accident so i tried it  the dogs would not even touch them  wow   <br  >i would have given them only one star but the bone is good etc   just a flavor that does not work 
health	two years ago  i had posted a most laudatory review of these nutritious  safe dog treats  no longer  this is what i wrote today  feb 27  2016 about a drastic change in the texture and quality of this product  now a dental disaster threat  my dogs had loved them  a wonderful gift for dog loving friends  soft  a bit crumbly  but not muchly so and ever so good  i would used them with my dogs for over 8   years and visited the factory in anchorage  in july  2015  i bought 5 bags when seattle costco re instated them  how y c had terribly changed their product  every one of the 5 bags contained hard  hard little squares  so hard that i could not even break them at the score line  i soaked some in water  overnight  and the next morning  those two hard little squares were still all in one piece  but a bit slimy on the outside  took a hammer to each of the soaked two  yep  hammer broke them with a pretty heavy wallop  but i do not want to break my dogs  teeth and my dogs could not break them  and the jr is noted for jaw power <br  > returned them to costco  thank you  costco   and then ordered two other kinds on line  same results  hard  hard and all looked about the same  despite huge differences in price and  presumably  ingredients  in september  i called the company to express my concern at how hard those were  so hard as to present a dental hazard and to ask what had definitely changed the texture  i was told by the supervisor that they now were using an emulsifier which would  quot blend and break up hazardous fish bones  quot  has anyone  anytime had problems with fish bones      not in 8 years and at least 20 packages a year  asked about why the squares were now so hard  was told they were cooking to prevent salmonella   grrrrrrrr  couldn t tell if that was intended as a pun or the answer  called two other times  same response and not as friendly concerned as before  it was mentioned in a blog that this company had been sold and now is headquartered elsewhere  but idon t know that for sure  what i do know for sure is that the quality and texture has changed so drastically that i will not again order a single bag of any type of yummy chummies  from the approx  10 26  all the same  hard hard little squares only a canine dentist would love  they have lost a once grateful customer and my three dogs and many fosters no longer have a wonderfully safe and nutritious dog treat  why did they have to ruin a beloved product 
quality	grain is second on ingredient list and has waaaay to many   34 questionable  34  and ambiguous bi products  that indicates a low quality dog food  just because you see it in a vet s office does not mean it is the best for your dog  it just means a hill s rep cuts the vet in for a percentage  you can and should buy a better food for your   34 best friend  34  
quality	my dog shows no interest in this toy at all  not even the treat  would not eat the treat when it was offered to him with getting it out if the you either 
health	i had been using vetri science laboratories feline furball plus hairball remedy chew for cats with great success  but they became unavailable via prime and the other sellers were much more expensive so i thought i would try these  my cat seemed to eat these ok which is the first test  they are smaller and harder than the vetri science brand and you need to feed more of them  after about 10 days of these my cat started barfing again  so they do not seem to be as effective  found another supplier of the vetri science brand 
health	oscar  blood parrots  rams  loaches all love this as a treat  do not usually see fish so excited with other foods <br  ><br  >even though i knew the weight of what i was buying for the price i was a little disappointed that about half the container was shrimp dust
health	my dog probably would have loved these  unfortunately  he had been sick and passed away before i could open the box  returned for a refund 
quality	well  my cats did not gag when they ate them  but they did not seem very thrilled when i put these in the food bowl  other normal cats might really like these  my cats   not so much  but do not go by my recommendation  i would not eat what my cats eat either 
quality	i am sure that it is a great treat but my dog is soooooooo picky and will not eat it    
product	seems to help a little  but still not really doing a great job  that one cat still has a problem that even the vet cannot figure out  oh well  i will keep trying 
product	these are no good  they are way to thin and come in tiny little pieces  i will not buy this product again 
health	made my dog very sick  very sick would never buy again or recommend them  my dog is still sick after spending  227 94 to find out what is wrong with her  she got sick right after i started giving her these treats     
health	i have 4 dogs and read about these in a dog magazine so i thought i would give them a try  only 3 of my dogs chewed on them and 2 of the 3 dogs got sick  it was not a pretty sight  i would not recommend these 
product	i tried this brand for the first time and was not impressed  they came pulvarized  just crushed  i was expecting strips  not a bag of smashed flakes  my cats still enjoy them  but i like the other brand better because they do come in long strips  i just thought i could get more for my money  i am going back to my original brand 
quality	i do not care for this toy because to get even the petite dog treats to come out  i have to unscrew it quite a ways  to get the two sides apart   then it is rather loose and gets looser as it is played with  consequently the treats all fall out at once 
product	my dogs   and every dog   who has been offered this treat loves it  and i would buy it again except it is made in china  so it is off my list  i would not take a chance again with the product 
quality	my excitement and enthusiasm were short lived  the bottoms of the bones get nice and dark  but the tops stay light <br  >my dog will not eat either of the two recipes i tried  anybody wanna buy a bake   a   bone cheap      
quality	my dog loves treats  especially duck treats  she hated these  i use treats for training and she just would not eat these  wasted my money 
product	there is a film of     grease  on the interior of the ball so make sure you wash it before use  my chihuahua like it but the rubber is too soft it was easily damage after a few chews on it 
quality	my 10 yr old sun conure will not touch it and he loves chewing on anything  he took one bite  tossed out of his beak and started running away from me  even when i made believe i eating it and having the treat of my life  he just looked at me like i was crazy and flew away to the other side of the room <br  >so i guess treats like this really depends on the bird  because years ago i had 2 parakeets that would devour these things in one day  oh well  maybe i will eat it myself so it is not a total waste 
health	this product made our 5 yr old yorkie poo very sick  he began vomiting right away after consumption  overnight the diarrhea started  two days later  still sick  went to the vet   vet thought it was worms  he was so dehydrated he had to have iv liquids  started on special diet and deworming medication   back to normal three days later  gave him another brushing chew   and the vomiting and diarrhea started all over again  we realized  he never had worms  it was these treats <br  ><br  >spent  300 at the vet  read the reviews before you buy these   20  of them involve dogs that get sick  very disappointed in milk bone  will not be buying their products again <br  ><br  >we ve switched to wellness products  better ingredients and dog likes them just as much 
quality	threw it away  smelled horrible like rotten chemicals  my dog would not go near it  it is a massive bone  my dog is a pit  no matter how much i tried to coax her with it  she just was not buying it  wish i had not wasted my money on this  it is also very greasy  will leave stains wherever you set it 
health	nice product made in usa my dog snubbed these would not even try them  it is hard to find good products all usa made  i liked them but my dog did not  but they really are usa so not crap that could make your dog sick 
health	disappointed with this product  it turns mushy and my dog was choking on it 
product	went online to review the instructions  which give very clear directions on exactly how to dose daily with the   34 enclosed pipette  34   so i did all my calculations to determine how many drops a day to add to my 75 gallon reef  only to open the package to begin dosing and realize that they provided no pipette  if you are to give instructions that include a specific number of drops from a specific instrument  you should enclose the pipette as promised  i will look for some sort of measuring device capable of accurately measuring  35 ml  but really should not have to do that 
quality	i guess its ok but my betta will not eat them  maybe he is just picky 
product	my dogs loved these treats  but i cannot say much for the  hip support  the packaging claims <br  >make sure you fully close the bag because these treats will dry out quickly making them impossible to chew 
product	the treats were fine and my dog has liked them for a while  but they were shipped directly from costco  after looking them up on there they were marked up substantially  if you do not have a membership there  then i guess it is a decent deal because they are more expensive of drs f s 
product	okay  i have a 14yr old 92 lb boxer lab mix and followed the recommened dosage as such  this product did nothing for his farts or diarrea  waste of money for me 
health	i have been trying to help my three indoor cats lose some weight  my vet recommended this food and i bought a large bag  the first thing i noticed was a sour unpleasant smell  but i checked the bag and it was not even close to the expiration date  my cats hated the food  although they did get hungry enough to eat it  i threw it all away when one of them vomited  i do not know what the problem was  but i am very unhappy 
product	they were cute and packaged right and they came quickly  but our boston terrier puppy did not like them    now they just sit on the shelf
health	i cannot see how this is any different from the regular grocery store purina urinary tract formula  looks exactly the same  smells the same  cats do not seem to have any preference when presented with both 
quality	i do not like that you have to trim the little phalanges in the two holes  dog seems to have a hard time getting larger pieces out  40 lb  shepherd heeler mix  but she does like playing with it  especially when all the food in it rattles around 
quality	i have two guinea pigs and they showed zero interest in these treats   too bad  i thought they would like them but they were too big  too hard  not yummy smelling enough  i asked them but they did not tell me why they did not like them    maybe they are better suited for a larger rodent 
health	perhaps it is just her gastrointestinal system  but our 10 year old chihuahua had a problem digesting this product <br  >not so much as to make her sick extended period of time  but also had some diarrhea next day <br  >usually give chicken treats and perhaps this is just a little too spiced and rich by comparison<br  >tastes fine  though  i tried a bite
product	my dogs seem to like these dingo products pretty well but i quit buying when i noticed that almost all of them are made in china and there have been some significant problems with some of the stuff coming from there including dogs that have died  plus i do not trust china as to its animal cruelty measures with animals  i just do not have any confidence in stuff like this that comes from there and since there are so many other products available i have switched to those  a few of the dingo products are made in the usa but for the most part they come from china  my dogs are too important to take chances with and i do not want to support businesses that have questionable histories 
product	for inexpensive dog food  it is not bad  it does not compare in quality of ingredients to the premium foods  yet it also seems to be palatable and not cause a lot of gas like some bargain varieties  i cannot rate it higher because as others have mentioned  many of the cans were somewhat dented and a few were badly enough dented i did not feel comfortable using them 
health	my dog is sick and needs to take pills    these little nuggets were good for covering up the scent of the pills or medicine  however my dog got more sick and her liver function deteriorated  i really wish i could get a refund  please do not use this
quality	they look well made  unfortunately my roborovski hamsters  all 5 of them  are not eating it 
health	i used this product on my two dogs for 4 weeks once a week  their ears got irritated  red  and peeling inside it seems like it burned their ears instead of helping  do not use this product  i used instead malacetic ultra otic cleanser for their inflammed and infected ears  after one application their ears healed and they had not discomfort 
quality	cookies were dried out  the grooves are smaller than previous nylabone treat toys  i have powerful chewers  and this holds up to their chewing  the treat compartment is not very useful i smear some peanut butter in it because the dogs can pop the treats out immediately 
health	bought this bc the shelter was using it for the kittens  but one of my little guys had persistent diarrhea that would not quit until after i discontinued this food 
health	my 12lbs maltese became very ill from the application of this product  she started having horrible rashes  her whole body was burning and red  she was restless and lethargic and then she started having muscle twitching on her back and her hind legs  she needed to be hospitalized  some dogs are very allergic to the ingredients of advantix  i have read alot of other owners who dogs had similar or worse experience to mine  even death  stay away from this product  it is very toxic
quality	my rabbit will not touch this food  it also has a bad aroma to it  smells like its over preserved or some other kind of unnatural scent 
health	these are the bomb  according to my dogs  we also crush these into a powder and mix the elderly dog s medication with it  works like a charm  my only complaint is how much is included for the price <br  >update 9 2015  the price has gone up  10 in one year  plus the stated weight was short 3oz  there is no beef shortage  just a greedy vendor  why must they assume all pet owners are wealthy and will pay any outrageous p for dog treats  the only way to combat this type of unjustifiable and insane inflation is for consumers to boycott the product  shame on gimborn 
quality	i do not hate them but my dog does not like them 
product	i ordered these before and they were three or four times as big  these are like baby bunny ear sized  fifty of them fit in a one gallon ziploc bag with plenty of room left over   probably not even a pound for  40 00  do not be f by these if you bought them before   total ripoff  shame on them 
quality	it is not that i do not like it    the furbabies will not touch the stuff unless it is topped with wet food  there are many dry foods they will eat and they are all cheaper than sci di 
health	this does not work in the least  treated my two dogs with this product two days ago  third application in about two months  as the first two were not working  and they both have more ticks on them now that they did before   an infestation  no less 
quality	my dog eats many dog foods  but would not eat this one  he went 3 days without eating before i was forced to through it away and get him something else
health	my cats will not go near it  i hate dye in red cat food  i have two mature cats  one male  one femae  both adopted from the long beach humane society s kitty cove as adult cats  i also feed and house about nine feral cats  most of which have been tnr d  fortunately they eat anything  my indoor cats will not eat this food and frankly that is just fine with me because it has so many shapesx and colors  obviously the red is dyed with something  that i object to in cat food  cats barf  the throw up hair balls and somethimes just for the fun of it  they usually throw up on the furniture or area rug that is the lightest color and most difficult to clean  if there is wood flooring or tile  they run to throw up on something that requires heavy duty cleaning  anyone who has cats might agree with me and knows that the red dye is the most difficult to remove stain wise  i give this one star based upon my cats negative feedback and my view that gussying up cat food to appeal to the human eye is ridiculous 
health	i am writing this review to alert cat owners in particular  please be aware that this product may upset the digestive or gi tract of your cat  i bought this product in hopes of helping prevent future dental issues with my 11 year old cat  he had had a dental cleaning recently to remove some major plaque and had one tooth removed due to decay   he is healthy otherwise  i tried a small amount of the product on a cotton swab and rubbed it on his teeth and gums  this was later in the evening on friday  say around 10 30pm  and by 4  4 30am he was throwing up every couple of hours   poor thing could not even keep water down  i took him to the vet that saturday   they ran all kinds of blood work   even checked the pancreas  and  about  400 later  everything checked out normal and okay   thank god  but the vet told me not to give him any more of the dentatreat  it does have a lot of cheese products in it as well as milk protein   cats are known to be lactose intolerant  so i was a bit hesitant to try it  but there is not a lot out there for dental care that is natural for cats   without a bunch of synthetic additives  so please be aware  not all cats may react the same and others may tolerate it just fine  but mine did not 
health	did not help  cats had trichamonas infections that needed treatment  was not a lack of bacteria in the gut 
product	i am sorry  but it did not work well at all  it was a waste of money 
quality	i have purchased this product for over a year and usually my four cats all love it  but my last order was terrible <br  >i had ordered four bags  but in every bag  the   34 treats  34  were dry  squashed and clumped together <br  >they were not nearly the quality of other packages i have received  only two cats would eat them at all  but very unenthusiastically and very reluctantly  the other two cats would not touch them  i was very disappointed with what i received <br  >i have ordered the product again  only one package this time  as they have been recommended by my veterinarian  but i am not sure what i will do if the poor quality continues 
product	i got this for my macaw mostly because it said   34 large   34  the item comes with i think 5 of them in one package  so you have a few to kinda play with  i gave it 3 stars because my bird did like it  i however did not  yes  it is all natural and bird safe  however  it is a pain to put together  i did not see any instructions  which made it a bit confusing   you have to put a square part into a hexagonal part  the paper also does not stay closed when after you make the toy  so putting things into all the little holes meant that the first several attempts fell out  because the top and bottom are so loose  my bird would pick at a side and everything would fall out  this toy is probably best for a conure our cockateal 
product	flimsy and cheaply made  one was broken upon arrival and the other broke only after three weeks of use  i used it once a day to clip lettuce for my turtle  this morning i went to remove yesterday s lettuce and clip a new piece onto it and as i retracted the clip  it snapped in half  i had to net out all the tiny plastic pieces  save your money and purchase something else <br  ><br  >one more note i wanted to add  the clips i received were clear  they were not green an yellow as depicted in the photo 
health	boooo hoooo  i wish i read the other reviews before buying  we received these bones in the mail at 7 05 this evening  i am writing this review at 7 17 and my 7 month old puppy has torn through the first bone    now i am just hoping she does not get the throwing up and diarrhea others noted   do not buy if your dog is a chewer<br  >revised post  it is not 5 15 am an i woke to diarrhea all over the place   definitely going to write to nylabone about this   
product	poor packaging  a significant amount of the food was dust when it arrived and the bag had popped open 
health	made my jack russell sick  did not try it again    iexcl 
product	some of the smokehouse treats are made in the usa and some are tested in the usa but made in china  theses are tested       i did not feel comfortable feeding them to my dogs  delivery shipping was great and the made in the usa smokehouse brand i will purchase because they do like them  i just do not feed them anything made outside the usa 
quality	could not get my cockatiel to touch this  i am trying to switch him to a healthier pellet then what he is been eating but he will not touch this one  tried roudybush maintenance crumbles and he took to that with no problem 
product	the antler was a little larger than the ones other sellers sell for medium dogs  our dog loves antler chews but did not really like this one  this package is also a very poor value compared to the competitor offerings of split antler chews 
quality	the rubber is soft  but i bought more  the dogs have not chewed them up  but are not very interested in them  either  it is difficult to get treats in  so i cut some bigger openings  the rubber was very easy to cut with scissors  so it does not appear they would be good for strong chewers 
quality	i gave these antlers a 3 star only because my dogs were not very interested in them  however  my friends  dogs liked them 
product	dogs love them and they are the right length  but very disappointed in their width  most are barely the width of a pencil and the dogs chew them in no time because of it  all the other sticks i have bought else where hace always been about 1 5  2 inches wide  will not purchase again
product	went rancid after one week  used refrigeration  but still went bad immediately <br  >very expensive waste of money 
quality	these were terrible  hard    my dogs would not eat them  waste of money
health	after giving my shepherd one of the he had gotten sick and the whole bunch of them was wasted 
product	i was very happy to receive my package but  the box fell apart when i tried to bring it into the house  also  i am partially handicapped and it was away from my door so i had to take my cane to drag it to the house  i know the delivery people try to do their best and normally  i am very happy with my purchases and deliveries but the box being as heavy as it was  made it very difficult 
quality	i have to wrap these in cheese to get my dogs to eat them they do not like the taste 
health	very unsafe  my 2 60lb dogs chewed these into sharp pieces within days  one dog choked on a shard and the other swallowed a sharp piece and then vomited several times  not for medium   hard chewers 
quality	my cats used to only eat this treat and howl for it  then the look of the product changed and they do not like it at all  it used to be very white  now it is kinda yellow  tan  maybe your cats will like it  mine no longer do 
health	my pup did not care too much for these  let me rephrase that   her stomach or intestines didn t  she had bad loose stools for a couple of days following one of these as a treat  i use the stewarts beef and chicken liver treats with no ill effects  i could try these again  but then  i do have white carpets   0 
product	for the price this really is not all that  my cat s are not really into it as the treats fall out pretty easily  so once they are out they do not play with it  i have not tried with treats that are a little larger  that might work out better  the included treats are a nice bonus though  but keep in mind it is a very small bag 
health	i love this probiotic for pets with ibd  crf  pancreatitis  i do believe this product and a diet of   34 kitty crack  34  fancy feast classic extended the lives of my aging crf cats and quite possibly my cancer cat  i use it daily in small amounts so one packet lasts quite a while  extremely palatable and i have never had a cat reject it 
product	disappointed  dog had top unscrewed easily  even though i cranked it down hard 
product	my sheltie and schnauzer get frustrated with this treat wheel very easily as they cannot remove the treat <br  >so now they just lick it for a while then give up    
product	my 12 year old picky dog did like this  but it is too expensive to use long term and he did not gain a noticeable amount of weight on it 
product	i hate that i cannot seem to discontinue the auto ship program  i have tried 3 times unsuccessfully to stop shipment  so frustrated with this program and process 
product	i love the product but on this reorder i find that the reseal option is defective on this bag  plus the color is much lighter than normal so i am uneasy and have repurchased tho please note it is packaging and not the company that sold it as they deliver promptly
quality	i had been feeding my cat science diet kd and tried this because it is cheaper  it smells like corn and the cat will not eat it  even though she is generally not fussy about dry food 
quality	these were smaller than expected  flaked fish scales all over the place  smelled bad  and neither of my dogs really liked them that much  my bigger dog ate them because he eats anything  but the small dog would have no part of it  not worth the cost  in my humble opinion 
quality	these are great treats and have not had a problem in the past  however my last order of treats are not fresh and treats are brittle breaking into pieces
health	i got this in hope that my ferrets would eat this  i normally had a problem with y ferrets eating anything but their normal food  good news is they did  bad news is they both started chocking on it  the male ferret was able to split it back up  but the girls was not so lucky  had to make a after hours call for the vet  not cheap  she made it tho with sum laxatives and sum belly rubbing  so this seems to be a chocking hazard  threw it into the trash and gave the company a call to complain 
health	these are too thin and dangerous for my dogs  they splinter easily  i bough thick ones at my local dog store for about the same price 
quality	i was disappointed  product feels and kind of smells like plastic playdough  it also gives my dog runny poops  had to do process of elimintation  and turns out this was the reason 
health	had an incident with my dog vomiting after i gradually changed from taste of the wild to beneful    i was trying to save some money  i took him off it and he was fine again in a couple of days  i tried it again a few weeks later and he vomited it again after a few feedings  called purina to get some info and was stonewalled  since then i found adverse articles re this brand of food  i am going back to my previous brand 
quality	he ended up not eating most of it  threw it away
product	it was open upon delivery and spilled half of it is contents out into the box 
health	i used to give my shih tzu ppuppy blue buffalo but stopped after the last package was tainted and caused diarrhea in both my dogs <br  ><br  >i used to feed royal canin in europe and it used to be really good there   made in france <br  >this one is not that great  i can always tell how good a particular brand of dog food is by smelling it   i have a superhuman sense of smell  and royal canin us does not smell all that fresh and healthy  it is definitely better than purina and some of the cheaper ones but not as good as acana or blue buffalo even though it is a little bit more expensive <br  ><br  >i ll try something else after he eats it all 
health	beware of this dog food    i have 2 dogs  recently i fed this food to them and one of the dogs would not eat it and the other dog did eat it but he vomited and was coughing after eating it  i have read some other reviews from people who is dog had a similar reaction  i would not recommend this food 
product	my cat has not stopped biting and chewing on herself ever since taken cheristin 45 days ago  she shakes her ears constantly now  she had some kind of neurologic allergic reaction to it instantly after taking it  she had no reaction to frontline  the package on cheristin says may cause itching 
product	i like their other  heavier duty chew toys  like the blue jack with the rope   these are too flimsy  my french bulldog took a bite out of it on the first day  threw that one away and gifted the other 2 to a friend with a new puppy 
quality	none of my dogs will eat it  they will not touch it  nothing seems to be wrong with cans and not out of date  but they would rather starve than touch this stuff  i bought lamb and brown rice flavor  i gave it to my neighbors w  3 hungry dogs who will usually eat anything and they refused it as well  i will never re purchase  dogs hate it   
product	it was my mistake but i actually thought i was buying a much larger bag  this is very over priced  i can buy the same dog food in a 17 8lb bag for 75 00 from my vet <br  ><br  >delivery was slow but that was due to the in climate weather 
quality	a few other reviews have noted   the rubber smells awful  to the point that i do not want my dog playing with the thing  even after several tough  hand scrubbings and even soaked in white vinegar  the thing still stinks  i hope after some time it subsides but not so far     4 months later    still smells horrid  went into the trash 
quality	it did not entertain my dog   he chewed it immediately  we did not care for it at all 
product	this is a great treat  but with two sun conures  it did not last long  i only used it as a sprinkle topping for their regular food  it is rather pricey for the size of the container  i doubt i will order it very often 
quality	it seems to be very healthy and pure product  only my kitty does not like it <br  >i was not familiar with the texture of freeze dried food  the texture is such that if you press it  it would pulverize   <br  >it s very very dried  and my kitty only likes it if i pulverize it and sprinkle over her canned food  but then  what is the purpose of it is being a treat <br  >i believe treats should be good by themselves  something special besides normal food that our pets should really creave for 
quality	my kitten would not eat it what else is there to say 
quality	3 of my cats will not touch them but my sisters dogs love em
product	the product is good my boys loved it  the bag is awful to seal back  expensive 
quality	my gerbils are not interested in these  i have 18 gerbils  so that is a lot of uninterested gerbils 
product	update 4 1 2015   i am changing my original rating of this toy because petlinks customer service is amazing  sent me a refund for the toy immediately  still would not recommend to dogs who also like to chew  but very good company  it was immediately destroyed by my dog  50lb pitbull mix   once she got all the food out by knocking it around  could not get to her fast enough before she chewed it to pieces  maybe for smaller dogs who really cannot get their mouths around it 
product	if you want a refill for a larger dog  mine us a 72  boxer  and do not mind about a 10 minute distraction     perfect  or if you want an extremely expensive treat     perfect  third option  do not bother with any dog over 15  
health	mademy dogs throw up  at least this last batch we ordered  i will never trust it again  even gave it a break to see if it was something else causing it  but as soon as we were giving it to them  they started throwing up again  all four dogs 
health	seems to work a little but gave my australian shep diarrhea  german shep will not drink it 
product	this worked for a long time for my cat who is allergic to chicken  unfortunately he started puking quite a bit recently so i had to watch him to a more expensive cat food  i am not sure if they changed the formula or he just changed his sensitivity 
product	when i opened the box  this product had mold growing on the dog biscuits  very disappointed 
health	i am really going back and forth between 2 and 3 stars for this item  to be fair  i do not have any other chews like this to compare it to  i bought this grab bag because i wanted to try out new things for my pup  i was not about to spend  50 on a bag of bully sticks if she did not like them  i bought this item for a little over  30 with free shipping  not prime   it was awesome they did not charge me shipping to ship it to my apo overseas  it got here pretty fast  i ordered feb 24 and received my package march 3rd or 4th  even though they were not expected to be here until late march or early april <br  ><br  >i liked that these were all natural chews for my dog  they gave her bad gas and an upset tummy a little  that was probably my fault as i more than likely gave her too many at first  she really was excited about her first bully stick  she could have cared less what was going on around her when she figured out it was something she was allowed to chew on  the subsequent treats out of this bag were slightly less interesting to her  but she still heartily finishes them <br  ><br  >i like that there was a variety of chews in this bag for my dog to try out  however  i felt that a lot of the pieces were small or thin  my 60 some pound  9 month old german shepherd tore through the biggest bully stick in this bag in about 7 minutes  there were a few thick bully stick looking pieces that were maybe the length of my thumb  about an inch  inch and a half   i did not feel safe giving those to my dog because i did not want her to choke on them  so they were kind of a waste  the whole bag was pretty stinky so i had to put it up where she could not reach  the trachea s were the most offensive smelling yet lasted the longest  around 13 14 minutes   the beef jerky looking pieces lasted maybe 2 minutes  same with the thinner yellow looking things  maybe those were the bladder sticks   <br  ><br  >honestly  i would not buy this again  the amount of small pieces  the fact that even the largest pieces did not last very long  and the price are not worth it for me to repurchase  i took a shot with there being no other reviews  and even though it did not work out for us  i hope this review helps someone else gest pieces did not last very long  and the price are not worth it for me to repurchase  i took a shot with there being no other reviews  and even though it did not work out for us  i hope this review helps someone else 
health	did not notice that it helped any and when my dogs would scratch their neck  some of the stones would come off  but the area i am living in has a terrible flea infestation and the owner refuses to treat grass  not to mention i am living in florida  bug paradise   trifexis does the trick  though i hate having to use methods that are not natural  also considering purchasing a fogger 
product	i have a small dog that is not crazy about these but ate them anyway too many of the cookies were broken some were completely crushed  i would definitely not purchase this item again
product	i am so sorry to say that i bought this for a trip while taking our puggle for a few days  we will be moving and in all the turmoil the new package has been lost  i bought the collar too so hopefully it will do some good without the pills  she is a terrible rider 
quality	cat ate the first 1 2 of pack now will not touch it 
product	at  5 99 these were a great bargain  at  14 99 they were a rip off  while  7 99 is more reasonable  considering the flavors are old ones  it is not such a bargain anymore 
quality	my puppy seems to like the other iod treats i bought her  joint  health  but could not care less for these  i think she senses what they are for    
quality	i bought them because they are promoted as the perfect treat to put inside small waggles  the toys  however my dog was not interested in them  my puppy is a medium size 3 month old dog  so maybe these are all too small for her  i was a bit disappointed as your have to put tons inside and then without much effort from my puppy rolls them out and does not even finish eating them 
product	the ingredients are great  and that is what led me to purchase  and the dogs love the taste  but the product bits were so small that it was hard to even treat my small dogs  jack russell terriers   in fact  more than half of the product in the bag was dust     more than half  i was really disappointed in this product especially having paid so much for so little  i can buy ground bison for less than  10 00 a pound and make my own treats   i gave it a two star rating only because my dogs loved it and there was good intent on the making of the product  but i would never buy this again  at least from an online store where i cannot see what is in the bag  i have purchased many other freeze dried treats and have not had this experience 
product	canister was open about 12 bones in the box it was not what the item described i was disappointed
quality	i have bought several of these  tiki is a    great    cat food  highly nutritious  mimics mousies nicely  low or no carb   carbs are something cats get virtually none of in the wild  so  love tiki  the problem with the variety packs is the target demographic  cats   which could care less about variety  if you buy once to see which flavors your cat likes  no problem  be prepared to thrown away at least half the cans  of course  buying it more than once is the proverbial definition of crazy 
quality	my cats love this treat and i wanted to try this larger version as this treat is so popular in our house that i needed a larger size  i was a little hesitant due to previous reviews about the amount of   34 chicken dust  34  rather than pieces  but thought i would give it a shot  the package arrived today and i opened the vacuum sealed bag to about 95  chicken pieces and only about 5    34 dust  34   i was very pleased  however i do like some dust as i use it to sprinkle on josie s pills  he does not like the taste of pill pockets but once i sprinkle the dust over them  he can not wait to eat them up  i am very pleased a will be buying this regularly  i only wish i could get it on a subscription basis and have it automatically delivered every month <br  ><br  >update  6 11 15 just received my monthly order and it is not vacuum packed  rather it is packed loose in a bag and put in a shipping box with no insulation   equaling a bag of chicken dust  very disappointed  this is the first loose packed package i have received and i hope it is the last  i will order in july but if it comes like this  i will stop ordering
product	description says 6 inches  mine were over 9 5  34   much too big for my dog  she could not even lift one off the ground  very disappointing as it seems like she was interested until beaten by frustration  edit  i am glad to see the description has been updated to indicate that the antlers may be 6 13 inches and more appropriate for large dogs  i would agree 
product	a lot of the cans had dents  nothing wrong with the content  but could have been packaged better
product	when item was received  box was partially damaged and looked like a severly used box  not very presentable 
quality	this seemed to be a good alternative to the science diet cd formula my vet reccommended  but my cats would not eat   but the cats are starting to get really picky and do not want to eat this one either
quality	the inside dried out quickly to the point where my dog became uninterested  tried putting water on it to loosen it up but no luck 
quality	they sent it four houses down from me first  my lab will not eat them no matter what 
health	12 pound poodle completely destroyed it almost instantly  ripping it completely in half and leaving its remnants as choking hazards everywhere  i thought these were supposed to be strong resilient   
quality	my puppy likes the regular large breed food but did not care for the lamb flavored 
product	we purchase this food every month  and usually there is not an issue  this time however  there were huge issues  i am not sure if they changed packaging  but this food came in a plastic taped shut bag  weve always gotten the paper bags  and that is what is also in the stores  this bag was plastic  and taped shut on the bottom by clear packaging tape  and on the top by red tape  weird  then we opened it  and it did not smell like the normal food  we compared the smell of the prior bag to the new bag  and the new bag smelled completely different  like mulch  we will def not be feeding rusty this bag of food  because we are worried about its validity 
quality	my chihuahua would not even touch these  i even tried to reheat them  plus  he is normally a duck lover 
quality	my dog loves these bac n cheez when i purchase them at our local pet store  unfortunately  these dog biscuits arrived and did not have the scent flavor of the ones he is used to do  they seemed   34 stale  34  and he would not eat them  i ended up throwing them away and went back to buying them at our pet store  maybe they have been sitting around on a shelf too long 
product	these are dry and seem very blah  my dog does not really go crazy for these as he would other treats  i would not buy these again
quality	have not been able to use this as my pup has not yet arrived  but this thing stinks  i did not see any note that it is scented  not sure if i missed that  it is so minty that the whole room i have it in stinks  and it does not seem to be getting any better  i cannot imagine a sensitive dog nose tolerating it   mine doesn t 
product	my bunnies love this  and  aside from oxbow  it seems to be some of the healthiest bunny food i have found  without being overly expensive <br  ><br  >however  it has bits of dried carrot in it  carrot should really only be given to bunnies as a treat  aside from this concern  one of my buns insisted on digging through her bowl every single time we filled it  just to find and eat the carrot pieces and not the pellets  without supervision for this  they end up wasting the vast majority of their food by looking for those stupid carrot pieces 
quality	my dog loves lean treats  however  i bought them from this company for the first time and they are dried out and spoiled  they crumbled when i broke one in half  they had to be returned  will not buy from this company again 
product	my dogs love these so much  but i freaked myself out after reading that dogs have died after eating these things  out of curiosity i put one in a jar of vinegar for 24 hrs and it barely disintegrated or got soft  i know that i am not a scientist but i just wanted to see what would happen  seems like it would just swell in the dogs belly at best and i can see why it could cause blockages in a dogs intestines  i used to give my dog 1 day  so now that i bought this large box and got another dog since  i will be feeding one per week to each dog until they are gone and then not buying anymore  i read that greenies has changed their format since the incidences of death and illness have occurred  but please monitor your dogs when eating and after 
product	these work great  but they are expensive  especially when your dog takes pill every day  there is an easy recipe for pill pockets on pinterest 
quality	i purchased this fancy feast in gravy   my cat patty would not eat it  she loves and eats only fancy feast in gravy  her favorites are beef this one and chicken and turkey  this product must have been a bad lot from the company or the vendor because patty would not eat it at all  i tried can after can of this batch and she just refused to eat it after smelling it so i had to throw all 22 cans left away  after throwing this away i was able to purchase fancy feast beef in gravy in a store and she went back to loving it and eating it every time i put it down for her 
quality	outside birds did not eat these   note to future buyers these are not dry dehydrated crickets they are wet gooey smelly falling apart crickets   
product	i am really surprised at all the 5 star ratings here  yes  the birds like it  just as much as they like any type of suet i have put out for them  not any more or less  this brand is definitely cheaper  but the problem with these compared to others  ptf  is that when you pull them out of the packaging and try to jam them into your log hole  they completely crumble and fall apart  half of it ending up on the ground  they do not stick together like other suet plugs or cakes do  so even though they are cheap  i will not buy these again 
product	i ordered a package of 3 and all of the pill pockets were hard and crumbly as well as discolored  i then purchased a single package from another source and had a similar problem  out of the last five packages purchased  the first one was great  my dog loved them  and the rest were awful 
health	this dog food killed my cat  i am a passionate animal lover and have both dogs and cats  i started buying this brand based upon trust of purina as a brand that provided generations of animals healthy food at a reasonable price  i had a cat that when i would feed the dogs enjoyed licking their bowl and sometimes stealing a bit of their food if it feel out of the bowl  within one month  he passed away and shortly thereafter my one dog started vomiting  and then i finally saw the news about the lawsuit  i read the ingredient list and followed with due diligence the potential risk with them  my heart sank  i realized that by choosing this dog food i had not only been hurting my dogs health but had caused the death of my beloved cat 
product	i purchased the advertised 6 7  34  bones for my extra large dogs because i was looking for non china bones and there was a comment as to their origin from a customer back more than a year ago who said that the larger bones were from china but this size was from brazil  so i bought these believing him  upon arrival  i gave three of these to my dogs  i agree with the other reviewers  these bones do not measure 7  34  and they barely meet 6  34   the dogs went through the 3 bones very quickly  too quickly in my opinion to make them a good buy  i guess they are tasty  but good rawhide should be more of a gnawing experience and less of a eating experience <br  ><br  >before i gave my dogs any more bones  i happened to read one of the little paper wrappers that annoyingly are around each bone and was upset to read that these bones do originate in china  i was very upset and tried to get my money back  i got no satisfaction  stores123 does not state on their site or on the outside of the box the correct origin of the bones  only on the little tiny wrappers  so i will not feed my dogs the remaining 17 bones and i cannot get my money back  so  no   i will not be buying these bones again 
quality	sorry to say my two cats do not like these treats
health	be very careful with this product  given too much  it can make the cat very sick  be sure to follow directions precisely 
quality	these sound like they would be so good for a treat for my pups  but  so far  they do not have any interest in them  sorry to say 
quality	do not buy from this seller   i usually by these treats from my local vet  they are a chicken treat   healthy for your dog  due to the distance to get them  i thought i would buy them from amazon  these treats are normally dark brown   so soft they almost melt between your fingers  the ones i got from amazon were so hard  that i had to use a knife to cut them for my chihuahua s   the color was a very light brown  my dogs always love these treats  those that i got from amazon  my dogs sniffed them   walked away 
product	i got the barnacle toy in size large for my ~45 lb mutt  she enjoys food toys  and i wanted to find one sturdy enough that i felt safe leaving her with when i left for work since she tends to destroy her toys quickly <br  ><br  >first thing    there is no way any dog is going to be able to destroy this  the   34 rubber  34  is super thick and a good balance of flexible and sturdy  so she cannot do her favorite   34 pick at a weak edge and slowly disembowel it  34  trick  i have had it for a couple months now and it looks brand new <br  ><br  >however  it is not great for feeding her kibble  she eats 1 cup at morning and at night  and none of the compartments fits that comfortably  i do not really feel like dividing her food into 3 portions every day to split it between either  the bigger problem is the hole size  or rather the ratio of kibble to hole size  the holes are very big with rubber   34 fingers  34  inside to slow the food spill  i have still found that it tends to dump a fistful of kibble all at once  or not let anything go for a long time  this may have to do with my dog s   34 technique  34   as described below <br  ><br  >another problem is that since this has three separate chambers  this toy is not hollow and is surprisingly heavy  while my dog has no problems throwing a kong around  and i mean throwing a kong around   the weight and asymmetrical shape makes it difficult to throw or roll  which is my dog s preferred way to use a food toy  this toy works best when a dog slaps it with her paws or picks it up and drops it  which may be why my dog gets frustrated with getting her food from it <br  ><br  >what this toy is really great for  for us  is high value treats  if i am leaving at an unusual time and anticipate that she is going to fuss  i can put   34 the good stuff  34  in this toy and then she does not mind the struggle at all  the different size chambers make this especially nice if i am breaking up odd sized or home made treats and want her to stay busy for a while  since it is so sturdy  she can chew on it all she wants  but she has to do the work to get the treats <br  ><br  >all in all   this toy is not great for my dog s daily feedings  but it is great for high value treats and a change of pace n chew on it all she wants  but she has to do the work to get the treats  all in all   this toy is not great for my dog s daily feedings  but it is great for high value treats and a change of pace 
product	the rubber along the top was a little messed up when we got it  we kept it but its not worth the price 
quality	has a very strong odor of garlic  my fish  hippo tang  does not like it compared to other types i have used 
product	this food is great for oral care  the kibbles are dime sized so your pet has to chew them  however  for piggy cats  they may just swallow them  mine will do this occasionally and strain their neck in order to swallow  the ingredients are decent for a dry food  the price on this item changes frequently  which is annoying 
product	i thought we finally found something for our pit mix to chew on and not destroy  i was very wrong  all the packaging and adverts said it was indestructible  that it would last  it lasted about 2 minutes before my do had parts of it chewed off 
health	my dog likes to chew and loves the dinosaur nyla bones  so we thought we would try these out for him  he has a sensitive stomach  he devoured the bone in one night and woke up early the next morning with diarrhea  be careful if your dog has stomach issues 
quality	packaged well  they feel good in the hand  my dog s are not particular at all but will not eat these 
product	this is the worst seed mix you can get for your bird  it is mislabeled and not the seed you are expecting  on top of that it is not eligible for return and now i am stuck with throwing away 25 pounds of seed mix       if you want healthy birds do not buy this
quality	too big for our lab  she buried every one of them and did not eat them  i will not buy these again  seems like a quality product  but just know that they are large and probably good for strong chewers 
health	cats loved them  but the vet recommended 5  treats day  and it got expensive  i now buy lysine tablets at my local drugstore  crush them and mix with soft food  same results   helps keep my cat from getting sinus infections caused by his allergies   go figure 
quality	my dogs will not go near these    i purchased these for my dogs – all of them love peanut butter treats  but unfortunately  all of my dogs refuse these   and no dogs are not picky  they will eat pretty much anything  to make things worse i ordered a case of these  i might end up donating them to the dog shelter or what have you  they are supposed to be solved but when you get them and open them up  they are kind of like some sort of heavy brick  after i attempted to give them to my dogs  i put the bag in a sealed container – soft treats were extremely important to me because i have a couple older dogs and these sayings are god awful  personally  i would stick to the bil jac  gooberlicious peanut butter soft treats – my dogs cannot get enough of those 
product	parts were broken on arrival   dog had no interest in the toy   no challenge to find treats at all   simple flipping over of the toy and all the treats fell out  not worth what i paid  oh yeah and the instructions were printed backwards on the paper   cheaply produced top to bottom 
quality	many were dried out and did not contain any product in the tube  it was too long of a time before i realized it so i could not send it back 
quality	the last couple of bags  kaytee forti diet egg cite food for parakeets  i bought smelled like rotten meat  i had to throw them out  as they made the whole kitchen stink  i do not know if they changed the formula  i am buying one more bag  if it still smells like rotten meat  then i will just buy the kaytee forti diet pro health food for parakeet  the parakeets like that one also  update  03 25 2015   they have definitely changed the formula  still smells rotten 
quality	pretty cheap made and i do not really get how a dog is supposed to do this  its just kinda teasing  my 2 year old daughter has more fun then my 12 year old dog he just looked at it and walked away normally if it was a ball or treat he would be all about it
health	these made my dog sick every time i gave her one  had to switch to a different brand  no longer gets sick  frustrating because they were kind of pricey and now i have a big box that i cannot use  guess i will try to donate them to a shelter 
quality	we have four cats  two unpicky eaters  a feral cat that eats everything and an anxious cat that is a picky eater  the two and the feral cat will not touch food if any of this product is in the dish  the anxious  messed up in the head cat will lick all the moisture and gravy  if any  off the food then leave it  will not give it 1 star because it is a quality product but if no cats will actually eat it stand alone or with a small amount added to any other brand what can i do  subscription canceled and left with expensive food for the neighborhood strays 
quality	i am sure this is a good product  hills always is  but i had to stop it because the cats did not eat it  rarely they would try it but walked away  my concern is that now i am on subscription and not sure how to stop it before it is due again  march 18th   i still have the bag and use it as treats in between their regular meals  in the past  i never had problems with hill s science products  but these two are not cooperating 
product	i will still use them  but animals learn very quickly they are not really treats so they stop eating them 
product	total false advertising  one package  not five  and not eligible for returns  can get better price elsewhere 
quality	my cats love it and they do not stink up their litter box since switching to the wet brand  they also have pretty regular stops at the litter box which is great 
quality	they are not soft at all  my dogs could not eat them   they have issues with their teeth  which is why i get soft treats  
health	my dogs vomit blood after eating these  i have two 45 lb boxers  ingredients in these come from china  i strongly recommend not buying these 
health	i guess it is ok and the cat likes it but the triangular shaped kibbles are very large  at least for my smaller cornish rex and the sphinx will not touch them  the cat has vomited up a pile o  half digested kibbles several times  i am going to try the sensitive stomach version and see if the kibble size is smaller  i think that is the issue 
quality	for some reasons my dog does not like it at all  it smells like rubber and also make his stomach run 
health	item was received on time and as expected  but after reading several online reviews on this item and the harm it has done to other people s pets  i will never purchase this product again 
product	not only could my cats not figure it out  neither could i  it is also pretty large and heavy for a cat  my dog did not like it either though  as he got just as frustrated with it as the cats and i did 
product	it is a good product but was more expensive than in my local pet store      
product	the description of this order plainly states    34 four    34 4  34   containers of 14 oz temptation tumblers  34      this is the epitome of false advertising and product entrapment       of course  i opened the package right away   to give my kitty cats some treats  as they just love them   and  when there was only one  1  container  i automatically thought    34 i guess the other three  3  are arriving under separate cover   but  no o o o o o o o o o o o  i paid  28  for one    34 1  34   container      well  n e v e r a s s u m e       for my refund  i will   34 o n l y  34  accept an amazon gift card for the amount of the additional three  3  containers i was expecting to receive in my order      i will be purchasing this product at petco from now on     please revise your product description      mitzi ashcraft roberts
quality	i was really excited for these treats because training sized grain free treats are tough to find <br  ><br  >unfortunately  these are the only treats i have ever encountered that my dogs do not like  it is crazy  i have 3 dogs  two of them will eat anything  but for all three dogs  once these treats hit their tongue  they literally spit them out  they will not eat them 
quality	although i have used this before and had success  this time i did not get the same results  normally this product works within a couple of days however  my dogs are still complaining and their ears itching  i think perhaps i received a bottle that was diluted or out of date  all in all  the product is normally good  i just threw away  70 on a bad bottle  i hope this company stands behind their product 
product	the order was received in a short time and was well packaged  my 9 mo  old dachshund mix  16 lbs   so enjoyed his whole elk antler from a chain pet store that i decided to try these split antlers as the marrow was exposed  he chewed some on the first one then abandoned it in favor of his whole antler after the novelty wore off  the second one for some reason held more attraction but the old whole antler was preferred  now that it has been worn to a nub and tossed he is concentrating on the second split antler  my next order will be for the pair of whole antlers and i will provide a review of those  i feel that these were a good value 
health	within a week of feeding  one a day  to my 17 pound dog he developed urinary problems and is now leaking sugar from his kidneys into the bladder  although this does not prove a cause and effect relationship  taken with other similar incidences the case is pretty strong  my vet is reporting the case to the food and drug administration that is has been investigating these made in china treats  given the number of animals that have been sickened died from these  they should have been recalled 
quality	had to return these  they were hard and stale  not soft and chewy  this seems to be the problem with all the yummy chummies i have ordered online  the only soft  fresh ones were those purchased from costco and i cannot find them there anymore 
quality	my cat has always loved this product  this is the first time i bought it online  one of the bags is stale and so the pieces do not soften in the mouth  my cat would not eat a singleone in the bag  the second vag that i ordered at the same time was fine and my cat is happy  i just wish i had been able to use both purchased bag of treats 
quality	my cats do not like this product  of course  they both are very picky eaters  when given these<br  >cat treats  both gave me an   34  are you nuts  34  look  both are older cats and set in their ways so<br  >will not buy again for that reason 
product	does not seal  so was disappointed in that  paid only  4 for it  so i will keep it
product	dogs love them ate them in 4 minutes  a little to pricey
product	the description and picture makes it appear as thought you get two in the pack but you only get one  it is too pricey to purchase this online for only one  4    3 shipping is too much for one  the kong itself is a good product 
quality	my dog is like a crow eats everything  but she refuses to eat this chicken jerky  i can only imagine what is it made with 
product	dogs did not enjoy these  one would eat out of desperation but the other chose no treat rather than one of these 
quality	they have not eaten them at all  will have to donate them to human society maybe the ferrets their will eat them 
health	beware     small bones in this product will cause your dog to throw up and be violently ill when swallowed  could even cause intestinal blockage  i have a shepard puppy that got extremely sick and spent hours throwing up small bones and particles  i thought he might have had to have surgery  i love merrick products but this item should be pulled off the market 
health	there was much puking and liquid pooping involved after giving my dogs these things <br  ><br  >i gave them a greenie two times  the first time was not so awful  a little diarrhea  and i chalked it up to   34 it happens sometimes  34  and watched them  the second time i gave them one  hours later  after their dinner  the lab puked everything in his stomach  until he was producing only bile  and several times just bile  <br  ><br  >the next three days he was not right  i was getting ready to take him to vet when he started becoming normal again <br  ><br  >my terrier and spaniel both had the runs for more than a week <br  ><br  >i then googled to get info on these things  should have before buying  and discovered that greenies are deadly  i am lucky my guys were not puking and pooping blood  i am lucky they did not die  many dogs  and cats  have <br  ><br  >i then did an experiment  someone did that before me  from my googling  i just repeated it  by snapping off an end of a greenie and putting it in water   the result was a solid  extremely slimy  god only knows what kind of substance  that i would never  ever allow my guys to ingest <br  ><br  >save yourself heartache  do not use this awful product 
quality	our cat is not eating this  she loves the same product in the smaller  3    bag from the pet store 
quality	this is the 2 8 oz  size  the 1 4 oz  size can also be purchased through amazon but this is identical but less expensive and 2x the amount  not only do i give this to my very picky 3 yr old havanese this as an occasional treat but i also break up a piece or two to add to his food  or use some of the liver dust  to motivate him to eat his meal  it does not seem to work  they are easy to break up to give him a small piece  both of the bags show a cat and dog  they are for a very small dog  or a cat  just hand break up the pieces as needed <br  ><br  >i rate dog food not by my dogs preference  we all have our own   but how it made and where it is made  some people are very picky and have specific tastes  too  as far as he is concerned he does not care for these  but he prefers stewarts dehydrated beef liver or gimborn stewarts dehydrated pork livers  he is very picky for a dog  spoiled a bit   i do not know for sure what type of livers these are  the process  or where they come from  says usa but if an item is from china  it still says packaged in usa  but since he does not like these i will not order them again  i would say they are just ok by him  good by me  other dogs that will eat anything  seem to love them 
quality	the dog loved the chewable one  but it was too easy to eat    my dog was not interested in the other bones  but i have heard other dogs love them 
product	having only bought pill pockets in the past  i will never buy these again  it is super hard to form this pill treat over the pill even if the pill is small  not very helpful as a pill pocket  but my dog still enjoys it as a treat  which is the only reason i did not give this product 1 star 
health	the treats came with the seal opened    i had to throw them out because i did not want my fur babies to get sick 
product	i was super excited to find this sweet deal  unfortunalty  the product bucket was delivered cracked and all the little spilled out into the deliver box    not the end of the world  but super annoying 
health	these are ok  personally  i believe if youare going to feed blood worms  do not get these  go to your pet store ang get frozen blood worms  although my fish seem to think these are ok  i do not like feeding them  they feel low quality compared to frozen options  the product is very dry and almost kind of dusty  it is not a quality issue with one can  this is just how dried blood worms are  unless you are taking your beta camping  or you do not have a freezer  skip it 
product	not nearly as durable as the original kong  my dog was easily able to rip off the circles 
product	item stated it was a large size when purchased but i received a medium treat<br  >very disappointed since it obviously wont fit in the large treat holder
product	item stated it was a large treat when purchased but i received a medium one  very disappointed since to obviously wont fit in the large treat holder
quality	my dogs are not big fans of this stuff     tried it     but my dogs just do not like it
product	my golden destroyed this thing in 15 minutes  for a dog toy  it is made of some pretty weak material  i would not buy another 
product	the ball smelled like a greasy tire  no matter how many times i washed it and rubbed treats on the outside to get my dog to smell the treats and play with it  he wouldn t  the entire toy was masked by this greasy smell and my dog wanted nothing to do with it  i may have gotten a faulty toy  but it was completely a waste of money 
quality	cat could not care less about this  it just leaves treats all over the floor when i accidentally kick it 
product	i own a dog walking business and quickly became very popular at the dog park with theese treats  the dogs love them and even the most stubborn or self thinking dog learn to come quickly with theese treats as rewards  my issue is i was buying theese treats in the 21oz pale a couple at a time up untill recently    they went from  24 97 to the price they are currently  i feel this is way over priced and cannot see how they can justify such a large price jump    very disapointed   
product	my dog loves these  i was disappointed to purchase a bag that was full of mold  i have never had a problem before  whether i purchased via amazon or my local costco  but i could not believe how much mold i found in one bad 
quality	ok  i ordered this product as a result of a recommendation from the seller of my yorkie  but these things are huge  my little 1 9 lb and 3 lb puppy cannot seem to chew these  i tried and cannot even get them to eat them  these treats are not soft  they are hard and crunchy  they are about the size of a nickle  maybe even a quarter  they are about a quarter of an inch thick  i am having zero luck with getting them to eat these to even tell if this product was worth it  so far  i have to say it was a waste of money for me 
product	the canned food is dry and hard on the top  underneath the crusty top it is moist  unfortunate  compared to hill s prescription canned food  there is no comparison  i would not buy it unless it is all that is available  my dog is on a strict diet due to reoccurring stones in his urine and has had two surgeries  i will look for hill s for my next purchase 
product	bag arrived open in the box  food spilled all over the place and had to dig it out of the box  very frustrating 
quality	my dogs somehow do not really like it  they are not picky with food  but somehow they do not like it   
health	less than one star after they sold out and changed the ingredients <br  >i emailed them and all that was replied is to send back to whomever i bought it from for a refund <br  >it s all about profit so the reduction in quality   contents is the new key ingredient  <br  ><br  >i have to cancel my monthly subscription for the instinct dry turkey   wet canned turkey<br  >the food now makes my dog have super loose stools <br  >no warning to the people who trust   buy their products  
quality	these are like puffed  crispy duck and not at all like the duck jerky i used to buy  i chose these because i felt they would be better for my dog  but she really does not care for them too much  she loved the duck jerky i used to buy her  but  because it was made in china and risky to feed her i stopped  i will probably just stick with usa made jerky 
health	give my dog diarrhea  they love to eat it but it makes them have diarrhea
health	16 treats a day is a lot  my cat liked them  but i felt like it was a third meal  he did have hairballs while eating them  so not that effecitve in my opinion 
product	most of the cans were dented  but did not appear broken  and food was okay 
quality	unfortunately  none of our 4 cats liked these  they sniffed and walked away  they may be  healthy  but are a waste of money if your cats will not touch them 
health	the dog food is a good brand and highly recommended  however  one of my gsds has a wheat allergy and this food does contain wheat  therefore  not the food for my dogs <br  >nothing wrong with the food  i need to look closer at ingredients before buying dog food 
quality	sorry  my lola would not touch these      weird feel  no chicken smell    
health	my cats adore this food and are pretty picky eaters  unfortunately i am discontinuing feeding it to them because it is not grain free and it seemed my older female cat has developed a food allergy  i wish fancy feast had more grain free options  there are only 2 or 3 flavors that are  because it is one of the few canned foods my cats will eat 
product	normally these treats are very good  the latest batch was dry and brittle when they are usually soft and chewy  i am going to request a refund or exchange 
quality	recall that i only received one pack instead of two as advertised and the pack was months passed expiration 
quality	my jack russel and golden will not eat this flavor  have not found any dogs who i can give it to  none like it  have had no problem with the beef and low fat beef 
product	lasted my dog a full three minutes before he had these completely chewed up  if you have an dog that loves to chew these will not last and are not worth the money  i would recommend getting some elk antlers  those things last for months 
health	it is no wonder why dogs love these treats  my little bichon had a seizure in 2012  the veterinarian said it was caused by a blood sugar imbalance from the molasses in her treats   a different brand  these treats have 3 types of sugar    7 ingredient is brown sugar    8 glycerine     9 cane molasses  you won’t see the ingredients list until after your purchase  also   10 is salt  salt is used to cover up rancid meat    11 is garlic powder which is a non nutritive that can be deadly to dogs  why is that in there    12 is natural smoke flavor – a carcinogenic  you can find a bad pet food ingredient list at azmira com or healthranger org or consumerwellness org <br  >also  these treats are manufactured “for” solid gold  so who knows where they were manufactured and how rancid the meat was at the time <br  ><br  >please  if you give these treats to your dogs  go slow  don’t overload their fragile blood system  and in the meantime  look for something better 
product	i have received over 12 bags and they were perfect  but the last shipment had one bag that the treats were old and mildew looking  when i wanted to return them  i discovered i could not return them to amazon  o  other than that  they are the only treat my dog likes and i love that they are checked by a usa company to ensure they are healthy  being that they are made in china 
product	price jump of  13  good job  lost another happy customer  i was not going to complain that 20  of the bucket is useless dust and tiny pieces      but at  36 compared to  23 it is not tolerable  i would pay more for an improved product but not to pad your pockets 
health	has anyone else received dented cans  dented cans allow bacteria to enter the food  it is a safety hazard 
product	should always read review first <br  >ad shows 4  14 oz  packages  but only 1 arrived  <br  >beware this ripoff   20 for one small dry food package  wow 
health	this does not include tick prevention  if you live in a tick infested area  do not use this on your dog  it is not sufficient  it also does not do a good job of keeping fleas off 
product	came all dented  cannot imagine the bacteria inside because of this and the fact it is a pop top  very negligent
product	it is hard to twist in and out  would not buy another 
quality	5 out of 8 of my rescue dogs will not eat these  
product	i did not realize when i ordered these just how small a package 4  34  by 7  34  is  and the   34 ideal size  34  treats are tiny  less than 1 2  34   which might be good for a chihuahua  but is next to useless for a great dane  on the plus side  my dogs love anything dingo  i used the treats as a topping for their dog food  i will still buy dingo twists  but not these 
product	awful product  did not come with suggested treats   one dog lost interest other crewed it apart  i would give it no stars if allowed  disappointed expensive misstep 
health	i had this exact same problem  my dog is a chihuahua mix  12 years old  6 pounds  i always crushed my dog s medicine and put it in a piece of bread  and he gobbled it up  i decided to try these because i thought he would enjoy them and would think of them as a treat with his medicine hidden inside  i used only a small piece of the pill pocket each day for several days and after about 5 days he had diarrhea with bloody mucus  nothing else in his diet changed so i stopped using the pill pockets  after a few days  the diarrhea stopped  so i gave them another try after a month and the bloody diarrhea with mucus came back  stopped using them  the diarrhea went away and i will never use them again <br  ><br  >also  if your dog has cardiac problems or any other issue that involves a low sodium diet it is important to note that this is the lowest sodium flavor of the pill pockets and they are 17mg of sodium per pocket <br  ><br  >i called greenies with the number on the back of the package and the customer service was terrible  they did not sound concerned and said \\ well  that is the first we have heard of this  no one else has had this problem \\  a simple google shows this is a common problem <br  ><br  >p s  i work with animals in animal welfare and adoption and am very experienced with dogs 
product	my dog loves the bone but if i do not take it away he would eat it all in one sitting  in two days it is halfway gone  definitely not a long lasting bone so for the high price i would not buy again 
product	i have a cat that never turned down a meal in his entire life  but none of my cats would eat this  there was almost all liquid  very little meat  i could pour the entire can into their bowl    and it smelled awful  maybe i got a bad batch  but at this price point i expected a lot more  i will not be purchasing this product again 
health	our dog loves this food but it gives her very bad abdominal problems  namely diarrhea  your dog may not have the same experience  we changed to a food from the veterinarian and now she has no problems  hope your dog tolerates this food better than our dog 
health	this made all 6 of our dogs sick  even though we properly introduced it into their diet in small portions  whatever the reason  the amazon response was fantastic 
quality	had to return it  my min schnauzer  12 lb  bit a corner off it the first three minutes of use      poor quality
health	i am ambivalent about this product  on one hand  my fish loves this  its kind of like crack cocaine for my betta  on the other hand  this will constipate my fish if i over use it  my fish almost died form constipation from this product  i guess if you use this as a treat  maybe once or twice a week  you should be ok 
health	our cats are not happy with this treat  caused some to vomit 
quality	my cat is very finicky so i thought i would try these snacks  they are probably good  but she refuses to eat them 
quality	ok  my dog loves these but they stink  i mean   they smell horrible  it is one thing to have dog treats that smell   they all do   but these literally just reek  if you are good with that  and then super stinky dog breath   you ll love these  but since we keep our girls treats in the kitchen   and she sleeps in the bed   we cannot use these 
quality	my puppy would not eat this bag for some reason but loved it in the past 
quality	my little dog would not even try it  he did not like the smell  so i had to eat it   i didn t like it either  passed it on to a friend with a dog of the same breed as mine   she loved it   just kidding about eating it myself 
quality	seed gets eaten  seems to provide nutrients  so it seems to be an okay product <br  ><br  >overall not really impressed  cereal pieces are wasted filler that she will not eat  peanuts seem to be disappearing from this product  previous bag had few  this bag has almost none  will probably look at different products 
quality	it was in good condition but my betta refused to eat it 
health	beware   you cannot return this item    my dog has food allergies and is very sensitive to any additives in food  we feed my dog our left over salmon skin all the time so i thought these would be nice as a treat  well i should have listened to another reviewer about the grease  the only ingredient is salmon skin but these things are coated with a brown greasy substance  i know salmon has fat but it should not be brown and watery  i also bought some cod skins these were excellent  not greasy at all very flakey  perfect for small dogs or old dog with bad teeth 
quality	not very good  my 3 cats did not care for it  they hardly touched it for days      until they got so hungry they could not resist 
quality	its larger than i expected and my cat did not care for it
quality	i think this is a fine product  but my cats are finicky and do not care for the souffle style  i have to take it out of the container and break it up for them before they will eat any of it  i like for them to have the garden greens  so will continue to purchase it from time to time 
health	my puppy still has the infection   been using it for 3 weeks 
health	i have pit bulls who usually devour anything without a problem  but these rawhides made all 3 dogs sick  one kept vomiting all night until pieces came up  and the other 2 were okay with it  the next time i gave them to the other dogs who were ok with it only  and they both choked and gagged them up  do not know why  they have had rawhides like this before and they are not made in china  but i would definitely not buy them again  they may be swallowing them too fast  but there is no way to stop that  so beware  i really was happy to find this product as it was priced nice  but would not risk it again 
product	i was overly impressed it did not really help with my dog 
product	these treats were so hard  not only could my dog not chew them  i could not break them with a hammer  do not buy 
quality	been using this for years as an overnight supplement to a raw food diet  received a new package  opened it  put out a few for my cat  he started to eat a couple then in true maine coon style started to pull out each nugget with his paw  but he was not playing   he was sorting    pulling out his large nuggets only  i looked and found many other kinds of nuggets  which he would not touch  checked the bag    regular nuggets were only about one quarter of the bag  there were three other types of food     smaller squares  thicker smaller squares  four point small star like ones  when checking the rc site i found that the other three were for   mother cats  12 year old cats and kittens  not spayed or neutered   this bag was new and sealed  rc said i would be contacted next monday  however  i do not believe i could ever trust rc products again  who knows what else was in this  contaminated  bag  amazon quickly arranged to replace my order  but i certainly declined the offer 
product	great treats  my dog loves it but i wish it came in a better packaging with a zip lock of some kind  the bag that was holding the treats was not seal air tight  i think there were air holes in the bag because of that i will not purchase this again 
health	i was excited to  finally  find a dog chew that would last more that 5 minutes  maybe have the dogs chew something besides the coffee table  the trashcan lid and the corner of the couch  i looked at a lot of different   34 long lasting  34  chews and this looked great  i even signed up for the subscription refills  i gave one to each of my dogs last night <br  ><br  >pros  size  about 6   8 inches  two tiny treats  does not appear to be a choking hazard like tiny  slobbery pieces of rawhide can be  so far  one dog likes the bone itself w o treat <br  ><br  >cons  oh  boy  now i am on a rant <br  ><br  >before i even gave the bones to the dogs  twice the treats fell out and i had to scramble on the floor screaming   34 no no no  34  and grabbing up the two little bone inserts before dogs scarfed them down  advice  insert bones over the sink <br  ><br  >the bones would not stay in place no matter how i pounded them with my shoe  the plastic bone was cold and inflexible and the holes just a tiny bit larger than the treats  one reviewer says that he puts the chews in hot water to soften them and then stuffs the bone in place  i will try that <br  ><br  >cost  if i have to buy replacement inserts and they do not last  it is gonna be a fortune for 15 minutes worth of me time <br  ><br  >the real test  i gave each dog a chew w  treat  within 3 minutes the treats were out and eaten  3 minutes  in no way is that a long lasting chew <br  ><br  >taste  this was mixed  one dog carried her empty chew around all night growling    34 mine   34  and glaring at all of us  the other dog dropped his once the treat was gone  did i mention 3 minutes    this morning the two chews are in the dogs  pile of other useless toys <br  ><br  >overall  very  very disappointed <br  ><br  >i hope you have better luck 
quality	the food itself sounds great  but my cat will not eat much of it  unless i am out of her regular <br  >it s unfair to rate a high quality product based on the fussy likes   dislikes of just one cat  <br  >i will say this  however  she does like chunks of food in a sauce gravy type base  and this is little squares  she really likes that food form   <br  >also  this variety of  beyond  really has to be served at room temperature  as the sauce is so thick  
product	my cats like it  but all the cans were dented badly
health	so hard my dog could not digest it  threw up the chunk i gave him about 7 hours later 
product	this product is made in china and chinese dog treats have been linked to renal failure  the manufacturer did not clearly state this in their description  not cool  i do not think i will buy another cadet product again  the country of origin needs to be clearly stated in pet food product descriptions 
health	the last batch of this i ordered was amazing and really did seem to help my kitty  so when i ran out i simply went into my account and   34 re ordered  34  the same item  when it arrived i noticed that container was slightly different but did not think anything of it and opened it and used it in my kitty s food as normal  within minutes of eating my cat was drinking water like crazy and then became violently ill  i was terrified and thought i might have to rush him to the emergency vet  but after throwing up several times it seemed as though he would gotten it out of his system and was feeling better  it was too much of a coincidence so i fished the old empty container out of the trash and compared the formula labels  the formula on this one is different from what i was previously using  and not just a little different but a lot  as you can see from the picture i have included  are you kidding me      is this even legal     i am grateful my kitty is ok now but i am extremely angry  i am returning the item for a refund and will be investigating this matter further   
health	love that i could get this heavy thing shipped for free using amazon prime   but   this is the dustiest litter i have ever used  there is a layer of dust all over the bathroom because of this product  tidy cats has another version of their lightweight litter  blue label  that is almost dust free  i could not get a good value on that version here so i am going to try another brand <br  ><br  >lightweight   awesome<br  >dust   you will choke on it 
product	our two 12 pound dogs love this product  just the right size and shape biscuit  low calorie count too  so that is all good <br  >but i noticed we were going through a bag a week  it was like a line item in my budget  <br  >so i looked and found a product twice the amount for the same price <br  >something about pets  the food products are all very expensive for what you get  the wholesale and retail markups must be enormous  our dry dog food  for example  is  when you calculate it  more than  3 to  5 a pound  what is up with that  i could buy fresh chicken or beef in the supermarket for that price  i just do not get it 
health	not for little dog like yorkie he is 4 14lbs  i found blood in his poop when i give this to my little yorkie overall the product is great he go nuts for the smell of it which can indicate that the food is good and it is organic but if you have a small dog like mine i do not recommend this because it could severely hurt the intestine even if your dog have digested in it still hurt their abdomens in which later on could pass through and create blood
quality	i was not impressed with the veggie crunch  and my yorkie was not either  she did not care for them  the veggies seemed to be spongy and bland  the coconut oil smelled old 
health	did cause some skin irritation in my australian shepherd  had to change to a different type of dog food
quality	after reading all the great reviews i bought these rice pops for my two guinea pigs and they refused to eat them  we tried tearing them up into pieces  leaving them whole  putting a little water on them  and nothing worked  they would not touch them at all  so just be aware that not every guinea pig is going to chow down on these  the majority may  but there is always a minority too 
product	claims to be   34 odor and taste free  34   it is not <br  >i do not recommend this for picky dogs or dogs that expect clean fresh water <br  ><br  >i did not sample this when it arrived  i should have  added it to my gsds water and went about my day  that afternoon i went to refresh their water and realized they had not been drinking all day  very unusual for 2 80lb gsds  this additive was the new factor so i got out the bottle to investigate <br  ><br  >sure enough  it does have an odor  it also has a taste reminiscent of clove oil you can buy in the store for toothaches  i sampled it diluted and straight  each method left the clove tingling on my tongue and the bad after taste <br  ><br  >again  i do not recommend this for picky dogs or dogs that expect clean fresh water <br  ><br  >inc a boring packaging photo since i like packaging photos     they wrap it in a baggie and toss it in a shipping box 
quality	my dogs did not like it and refused to eat any 
quality	very convenient and shipped to your home  a bit high on he price though  but when your dog will not eat just any dog food  you feed her what she will eat 
quality	my finicky cat did not like it  would not touch it  so i ended up giving it to another cat lover 
health	our frenchie choked on these so we went back to the toothbrush shape  good quality chews though with little mess  prefer the other shape 
health	be careful  vet advises against them  we tried them despite the warning  our poor dog vomited for over 1 hour  vet said they can cause obstruction and blockage  not worth the risk 
product	i bought several packs of these treats for christmas presents to several different cats  not one cat would eat them  my dog eats them so it is not a complete waste of money  but i was disappointed
health	this dog food cause my dogs to have diarrhea cannot use it any longer and cannot figure out how to cancel this revolving order please cancel
quality	i do not know if i just got a bad batch or what   but this is the second time i have bought a case of this for my shih tzh  the first time he could t wait for me to give it to him in the afternoon  he ate every morsel  i almost went on auto delivery  but i thought  well let us try one more single shipment  so  my second shipment arrived a few weeks ago  and i have had to throw most of it away  every can  it smells the same  looks the same  but gabe just will not eat it   i know the quality is supposed to be better the canned food i was feeding him before  buy the price is also higher  do not think i will buy again 
product	these are okay  but they do not really seem to last or do much of anything for our dogs teeth or breath 
quality	unfortunately my dog does not like the taste  i am going to try to put something on it so she will 
health	i thought this ad was misleading  from the picture i thought i was getting two kongs and was surprised when only one showed up in the box  the small pink kong i received however is a good size for my puppy but i wish it came with a larger one too so he will have a larger one that is not a choking hazard as he grows 
product	we have a two year old golden and were very disappointed with this toy  she chewed two pieces off within the first week  it is not durable for large dogs
quality	my dog liked the little pieces  the happy birthday bone was too hard  i could not break it at all  freshness was a big question mark 
product	these may work well as far as saving the grass goes  but first you have to get your dog to eat them  the biscuits are so hard they are impossible to break  i smashed them with a hammer  they still remained in large  non dog friendly chunks  even when the chunks were mixed in with food  my small dog either ate around them or spit them out  i had to throw all these biscuit rocks away  do not buy unless your dog is a very strong chewer 
quality	my cat was not interested in this one bit  i know that is not the fault of the seller as every cat is different  what was not good is the top where you turn it to put the treats in would not budge  it takes a lot of strength to do it and you end up with broken nails and sore fingers  it took me about 15 minutes to try and get it to turn  glad my cat is not interested in it because i would not use it again  not worth the aggravation to turn the top 
quality	one of my puppies will not even eat them  the other one does not eat but tried too  not impressing my pups  pyrenese   komondor
quality	my dog does not like the bones  but it is a great value considering the huge box  it would be ok if your dog is not picky 
product	i ordered 3 packages and each was so dry it was hard to wrap around the pill and we would have to use 3 pockets to just get one pill in my cat  i buy this in the store now and have never had a dry package since  my cat loves the taste and is eager for his daily   34 treat  34  
health	this was a waste for us  i am very weary about any nylabone product now after my dog got extreme diarrhea from one of their products    his system has not been the same since  these bones  in particular  are too small for any regular sized dog  in my eyes  maybe a miniature dog would enjoy these  but with my teething goldendoodle  the risk of choking was too high  i had to throw the whole bag away 
health	cannot give it 5 stars yet  as i have just started giving it to my cat  she is still itching and biting her fur off  but she does not seem to be getting sick that much  i cannot give her the total amount as they recommend as it is way too much to mix into her food    she leaves a lot because it becomes way too dry that way which may be why she is still itching
product	the size alone rated the one star  i have bought double the size locally  on a positive note  they were clean  no smell and delivery was good 
product	falsely pulls up under made in usa these are made in china 
health	my dog within min had broken the knuckle part of the bone which was turning into shards of bone  i had to take it away from him for fear that he would choke or worse the pieces would cut up him mouth and insides  i have had knuckle bones before that it has taken him months to break apart so i am not very happy with this bone   i have thrown it away so he cannot get hurt by it  
quality	not sure but my kitty is not eating as much as the friskies for kittens that i used first 
product	one pack had been punctured so we only had two to use and had to wash the other off all the packaging  i will just go to the pet store vet next time 
health	i have fed my chihuahua wysong for years  one quarter thru the bag he began to get sick each time he ate it  very frightening with a 5lb  ten year old dog  i had to throw it 3 4 of it away  it would have been less wasteful if you still made 2lb bags  i have switched to another brand and he is fit and healthy again 
product	food bowl is good but water bowl is not my cat hates it keeps drinking from our cups  water stays in there only to collect dust which makes it totally useless since you keep changing it everyday so why does it have to be big   like i said only to collect dust 
product	way over priced  holes too big treats fall out too easily
product	my cats absolutely love these as nightly before bed treats  i am very disappointed that they do not have the deal of a case of twelve of these for a reasonable amount   12 99 is a ridiculous price to pay for a single bag  i will go to the vet and get them for  6 
health	my labrador enjoys them  apple flavor   but 3 out of the 4 times he has had them he has had diarrhea after feeding it to him  this was with one bone given every 2 or 3 days 
quality	these treats were hard and seemed stale  i did not eat them myself  since i use them to give my dog her medication  that have been difficult to use  will not order from here again 
product	i can only give 3 stars because the way this was written marketed i thought i was receiving 6 bags and it was a great price  instead i only received 1 bag and overpaid  my dogs did like the treats but i did feel scammed by this way this write up was presented 
product	my dogs love the cookies so i kept them  however  for the price i expected a case and was disappointed when a bag showed up so be careful 
product	another situation where i wish i had listened to the other reviews  i am sending this back  it did not work  simply did not work  i give it one star for arriving  but otherwise  it is a product that simply does not work  so disappointed  i have been recording my voice on my cell phone recording device and playing that when i am out of the room  a much more effective option  except it cannot be played with 
quality	my little yorkie will not eat this food and i sure can t 
health	my cats hate this food  they love the limited ingredient turkey  but the one with allergies was still scratching his ears  so i tried the rabbit instead  they are very reluctant to eat it even after a month of feeding it to them  i finally bought some of the turkey to mix back in with it  now  they will eat some of the rabbit along with it 
quality	company is great but pet prefers a treat not so dried out 
health	made in china  the news is stating major pet stores here are pulling this and all product from their shelves  dogs are getting sick dying  
quality	dog loves them but for some reason both of thee antlers splintered after only one session of chewing  other antlers we have used have stood up a bit better  not sure why that is  again  she loved them but i had to throw away after only one day because they splintered and became unsafe  big investment for something that only lasted an hour or so 
quality	my cat would not touch these  and he is a treat whore 
product	not everlasting at all      my dog had it tore up into pieces within 2 days  he is a 90 pound retriever  i was hoping this would last him a while  nope  total waste of money 
health	the rawhide is very thin and my dog manages to simply crack the the rawhide and eat it in less than 5 minutes  he also manages to choke himself when attempting to eat the rawhide    not a fun experience to witness  if your dog likes to chew i would recommend getting super thick rawhide 
product	my cats love this type of cat food and was thrilled to be able to order it in cases however this is my 3rd order received full of dented cans so will go back unfortunately to buying future cans back at the store 
product	o being the worst the treats and the food were both expired i was so disappointed  customer service told me to throw the food away which i did and they would credit my account  i told them i only had a small pomeranian and the exertion had to last a long time it was the treats and the 13 2lb bag or nature s variety instinct chicken meal formula grain free  i am so disgusted  
health	great little pill pocket  but the duck brand stinks  dogs do not mind and one with allergy does not seem to aggravate his condition 
quality	these stink  they say chewy but they are dried out and hard as a rock  my dog is not picky and he just spits them back out 
health	i would not recommend buying these treats from this seller  my dog has enjoyed these treats for over a year  so i am pretty familiar with how they are supposed to look  i bought three bags from this seller  and right away i could tell something was not right with them  the color was much lighter than usual  and they also looked bigger than usual  i decided the smell was normal  and since the expiration date was still several months away  i let boomer try them  the next day boomer was hacking  and threw up a little  and he rarely has gi issues   i immediately stopped giving him these treats  i do not know for sure if these treats caused his episode  but it is the only logical explanation  i will continue to give him these treats  but i will buy them from somewhere else 
health	dog loves this  they tried to make the bag resealable  good attempt and idea but the zipper is not strong enough and its just separates  still happy buyer        follow up after a couple months  i read everything on google about the lawsuits and issues with some dogs getting sick  i am trying to judge this product fair without holding anything against them simply because a lawsuit is out against them  i did noticed my dog puke a couple of times awhile after eating this food  i currently switched dog foods a week ago and am waiting a long term answer  i have not had any problems yet  i am unsure if the puking was 100  from the dog food since my dog could simply be puking from eating a bone or another issues  i am ruling out this as a variable  i will follow up again 
product	my kitty has pancreatitis so the vet gave me some major expensive enzymes to help kitty digest his food  unfortunately  he did not go for the flavor  so i bought these  and the directions say 1 2 scoop at each meal  at first  kitty did not seem to like it  i personally use digestive enzymes and i had to go through many  many products until i could find the right one that did not hurt my tummy  i wonder if kitty is feeling the same thing  i love dr  mercola   dr  becker  so i am going to continue until this one is used up  kitty will need them long term  so i am hoping over time he will adjust to this formula 
product	most of the treats were broken into tiny bits  only a few were normal size  i will not buy these again 
quality	these are not the same consistency as other freeze dried liver  i highly doubt that is what they are  they are hard as a rock and 3 of 4 dogs will not eat them  do not buy 
product	dogs do not really care much for this snack for some reason
product	disappointed by the packaging and materials handling <br  >more than 1 3 of bags contained freeze dried dust instead of chunks of freeze dried chicken 
product	i love these treats for dogs and cats and rats alike  but they are expensive  i figured buying online would be my best bet  but alas  the inevitable consequence that i forgot to consider  they were crushed  almost half the bag was a powder <br  >wouldn t buy online again 
quality	my rabbit would not eat this  also you can find it cheaper locally 
product	i have been buying the duck fillet treats for my dog  a 10 pound chihuahua because she absolutely loves them and will do anything for them  have not had any issues with her or the treats up until this last bag that i bought  the treats look different  they are not thin as they have been in the past  the first one that i gave her was met with hesitation  that has never been an issue in the past but because it looked different and was made thicker  she acted like she really did not know what to do with it  i wrote to amazon about this and told them that it was different and i was hesitant to give it to my dog and they gave me my money back  they refunded my money immediately  i will be looking for the ones that i used to buy  and would not be interested in buying these again  but whatever i purchase will be from amazon their customer service is second to none 
quality	one guinea pig  princess piggy pie  will not eat them at all  ever  the other will reluctantly take it  and sometimes finish it 
quality	cat does not like them  will not even eat them without a pill  probably just a very picky feline 
quality	i was excited about these but my cats weren t  it dried out on the plate  the dog who usually licks the plates clean after the cats would not eat it either but  as it was all dried out at that point  i do not think the product can be blamed <br  ><br  >all that said  this is totally subjective  a couple of my cats are very picky eaters  your cats might love it  oh  it does look like it has actual bits of cheese in it  probably just made to look that way but still   
product	my 75 pound lab mix loves this but can eat one in less than 45 minutes  that makes these pretty darned expensive treats 
quality	my new puppy loved the individual packaged ones i bought from the local petco so i thought i would get him the big box but he refuses to eat this  i have one individually packaged left and gave it to him and he ate it  so i am not sure if the 2 products are different 
product	it made a big mess and broke into pieces unlike the more expensive ones 
health	good food but very expensive  i have two labs with allergies  i mix a 1 2 can of caned food with a half cup of the duck and potato solid food  the newer cans of this particular dog food are being processed differently and the dogs do not like it as much  the new recipe cost much more on an already expensive product 
quality	my border collie would not touch it  normally  if its real salmon  or salmon flavored  like the zukes salmon bites or blue buffalo sticks  etc   he will practically take your fingers off  but this must not be very good because he took one sniff and that was that  sometimes he will not even touch the other treats if its mixed in with a few biscuits  found this out when trying to sneak it in   i will be throwing these out and will not order again seems he does not like them 
product	our australian shepherd is very nervous during the rain  the thundershirt worked for a while  but she now associates it with the thunder  even though i try to put it on her in nice weather  the treats might work  but if they do  it is in a very imperceptible way  probably not worth the cost 
quality	my cat did not like the smell of the probiotic powder and refused to eat any food i mixed even a tiny amount into 
product	i only received one small box  not a case  a ripoff 
health	i have a sick kitty who needs to gain weight  i am now  unhappily  pretty much an expert on strategies to get an anorexic cat to eat  although he eats mainly canned food  he will also eat a little of fromm s game bird dry food  being the brilliant cat feeding expert that i am  i looked at the calories per serving of the other types of fromm s dry food to see if i could increase his caloric intake a little more  the surf and turf had the highest caloric content so i bought a small bag  this food comprises kibbles that are quite small  roughly 1 8 inch diameter  kind of like a bb pellet  compared with the other varieties  the sick cat ate just a little of it  and the two healthy ones were not giving rave reviews to it either  you might think that it does not really matter because cats pretty much inhale their food in lieu of actually chewing it  at least mine do   so they may have just not liked the flavor and or smell  either way  i have gone back to the game bird formula and everyone seems happier  fromm s makes very high quality grain free products in both canned and dry versions that i highly recommend  the surf and turf might be more palatable for your cats so i do not want to scare anyone away from it  it just did not work for my small herd 
quality	i mix this with wet food and my dog loves it  i know there is better quality out there  but for the budget minded this is a great deal  i monitor my dog  a beagle basset mix  to see if there are any issues with this food and there are none whatsoever  she has energy  a great coat and regular bowel movements that are solid  they changed the formula it seems and my dog stopped eating it  switched food and she is eating again 
product	am giving this rating since it arrived on time but pup hates it  plus it is not the color i was expecting  add says pink blue  figured pink would be the first color sent  she played with it for the first few minutes and never again  now it sits in her toy box along with her other expensive untouched kong toys    
product	my vet informs me that fleas in certain areas develop immunities to flea medications  which is why sometimes one works when another doesn t  here on the oregon coast  the fleas seem 100  immune to frontline  it is a total waste of money  advantage is okay  but the best topical flea medication i have found for my cats is vectra  which is sold only through vet offices  the price at my vet is comparable to advantage  another thing about advantage is that as soon as the seal is broken  my cats can smell it coming and they take off to hide  it takes a lot of wrangling to manage to dose them  apparently vectra is not as strongly scented  so i am usually able to sneak up on them with it 
quality	my dog  a chihuahua  sniffs this dog food and then backs up and sneezes  she will not eat it very sorry i bought it 
product	on the fence with this one  found out that a national store has pulled these from their product line as they are made in china and have been found to have some toxic ingredients  then i find out that when you purchase these on amazon you are not able to return them at all  period end of subject  our dog has loved them  kept her entertained for 30 minutes or so  shes a big girl at 118 lbs  so the toxic ingredients may not effect her as easy as a smaller dog  but cannot even imagine losing her so off her treat list they go  so sad about that 
quality	for some odd reason both my cats have turned their nose up at a can of this every so often   when buying from the store they generally gobbled this flavor up  maybe i bought a bad batch   anyways   some days they will eat it and others will not  
product	not for strong chewers  i received this yesterday and put treats in it today for our medium sized goldendoodle  she loved it and enjoyed getting the treats out  however  she easily chewed plastic chunks out of it <br  >when i went to return it  amazon took it back with free return shipping and refunded my account 
quality	i tried to give this to the starving stray cat outside  even she turned her nose up at it 
product	overpriced  found one just as good at menards for 1 3 of the price 
product	did not help at all  and could not get a refund with its return 
product	they are ok  they are kind of expensive and it only takes my dogs a couple of minutes to eat them
product	i am not sure if it is the shape or the taste but my english bulldog did not really care for this bone  he will chew on nylabones for hours and hours but lost interest in this bone is about 5 minutes 
product	i do not really care for it  it is not made very well  kind of cheap looking  i am scared to wash it  
quality	unfortunately  the cat i bought this for would not touch it  i left it out hoping one of the others would drink it so i had not wasted my money  but they all turned up their noses 
health	stay away from this product  known as kitty crack  it also has a growing track record as making kitties very sick  check out consumer affairs tales of woe for more 
product	way too expensive  price should go down with oil prices     dogs love them though 
quality	my dog loves them  my only complaint is that i do not like paying for the plastic bucket  i would rather just have them in a big bag and get more for my money
quality	my pups do not like this treat at all  i was so excited to try a different newman s flavor other than the chicken but it was a failure  my two pups who like to gobble just about anything have turned their noses at this treat  very disappointing since i have about 5 75 bag remaining  i have given this 3 stars because i did not think it was fair to give it one just because my particular dogs do not prefer it  perhaps other pups would find this delicious 
quality	not sure why but so far my cats do not like this food  they sniff at it and walk away  generally they love a little canned food as a treat but not this  going to donate to some people who feed feral cats in the area  actually now one of the cats is eating it so i am guessing my other two are just way too fussy  
quality	these treats are so bad my dog will not eat eat them  a waste of money 
quality	cats are not interested in the cardboard toy  not a winner in my household 
quality	my dog loves the nylabone durachews  i thought she would be thrilled with these  nope  she sniffed it and walked away <br  >i tried giving this to my other dog who eats everything and he sniffed it and walked away  waste of money for us  but at least now we know 
quality	my kitties will not touch this flavor  they love the chicken  salmon  and white fish tuna flavors though 
quality	my one year old mastiff received one for christmas  yup 2014   one third of it is gone  this will not last long  a lot of pieces  big pieces need to be picked up the days  doesn t chee on it every day  our three year old great dane could not care less about his so in a month when the mastiff finishes his he will take care of the other  a lot of money for a one month use 
health	way too large for small dog   would not buy again  gave some to friend with large dog and he got sick almost instantly    be careful
health	soon after feeding my cat started throwing up once or twice a day  at first i did not know what was going on but being suspicious i changed her to nutro natural choice  which she loves and i highly recommend  and it stopped  who knows  maybe the purina guys think drugging cats to constantly be sick and thus keep the stomach empty is a great way to avoid hairballs  but to me it means i will stay away from purina 
product	i have bought 3 packages of these bully sticks  my puppy loves them although the last bag  the 25 sticks were thinner than the previous 2 bags  so i feel i got less than my money s worth while the price increased 
quality	these treats are a bit too hard and stiff for my chow  he liked them  but too brittle  i also bought them without knowing they are from china  i blame myself for not checking thorough enough  i only buy treats when made in usa 
product	these are made in china and smelled of mold when i opened the bag 
health	we have always given our small chihuahua dentastix  however  that day has come to an end  after receiving my most recent shipment and putting them into use for about two weeks  my dog started to have episodes of frequent urination accidents and an increased drinking of water  a trip to the veterinarian ruled out a uti  cushings or addison s disease as all of her lab work was normal  except for one distinct imbalance  a review of her electrolytes indicated that she was hypernatremic  increased sodium  na    <br  ><br  >after reviewing any dietary changes with my veterinarian  it dawned on me that the only change had been a recent shipment of dentastix  some research on both our parts led us to the conclusion that these have a very high sodium content  while this is likely irrelevant to some small breed dogs  clearly has the potential to affect dogs as small as chihuahua s <br  ><br  >upon discontinuation  all the symptoms vanished  i have since switched her to an organic meat based treat has a lower salt content 
product	not my favorite  annoying to load it and one of my dogs actually undid the whole thing  which meant when i was not paying attention the puppy chewed the discs   decent level of difficulty 
quality	i did everything the package says but my 1 yr old bearded dragon will not go near it 
product	getting to expensive  will not be buying them again  why have they doubled in price since october 
quality	my five dogs could not stand in these  and my dogs will eat pretty much anything so… these just ended up going to the trash… nobody would touch them  have never seen one of my dogs walk away from a treat  attempted to give the treats to them several times but was unsuccessful  i am one of those people that does not like to waste food – even if it is petfood  i offered it to other families that had dogs and neighbors as well  the dogs declined them as well  what can you do  it is a food item that was opened so  that is why they went into the trash 
product	the dog and cat wait at attention for this treat  the size of the meat chunks varies from on jar to another  i have noticed of late  that the quality of the meat has gone down considerably  and the price has gone way up  i will not buy these any more 
product	just received the shipment today and according to the instruction  i am supposed to give this to my dog 3 4 times a week  however  these 4 bags  20 sticks each  have an expiration date of 2 months from today  how can i go through 80 sticks in 2 months  how can i do the product exchange without having to pay for the shipping again  this is so disappointing 
product	my dog liked the treat  but it lasted a total of 1 minute on a medium sized dog  overall product is too expensive for the quantity 
quality	please know that the cat food is probably great for cat s that can tolerate it  but one of my cats threw it up almost as soon as she had eaten it and the other one just walked away from it  we tried the tuna flavor with same results  i finally had to switch back to a more expensive brand that is completely grain free  i have two abyssinians and they were used to eating raw ground chicken but i was trying to switch them to something that was easier to have on hand so when i went out of town it would not be so bothersome to feed  most people do not like dolling out raw chicken either even though this is a natural food for cats 
quality	my extremely easy to please dog would not eat these  i know that is only one dog but he eats lettuce  paul  the owner  was really good about answering all of my emails until i told him my dog did not like these  then no answer  i will continue to buy the beef or chicken flavor treats which he loves and skip these 
health	love this product  worked wonders on my corgi puppy who had chronic diarrhea  i gave it three stars because of the seller  mostly  i bought a three month supply and when i opened the last box  2 months after ordering  it only contained 12 packets  i feel like i got scammed  definitely would recommend opening all the boxes if you buy more than one and counting the packets  these are too expensive to get ripped off    
product	the cat likes the food and amazon has the best price but probably every 5th bag or so the resealable bag fails and i can no longer close the bag air tight  i have contacted the company who generally cares and tells me to take the bag back to where i bought it for a refund replacement but what a hassle 
quality	i received these quicker than i had expected  unfortunately  not one of my four cats would eat these  even the dog would not eat them  i finally just put them outside thinking that the homeless kitties in my apt  complex would eat them 
quality	my 90lb american bulldog pulled the treat out in less that 5 minutes  but that is still longer that it takes her to ruin other toys  haha  i popped it back in and she is still going at it  even certain kong toys are destroyed by her  this thing is great  update  meh   nevermind  almost immediately after i posted this she started ripping pieces off  which of course means it is time to throw away  i guess i will have to stick to the classic kong and rawhide bones 
product	dog eagerly ate those in the first package i bought  the second package  however  is a different thing as she has consistently turned up her nose when offered these treats  finally  just tossed them    quality control  
product	what a waste of money  i expected so much more from something with the kong brand name  but my dog had this thing in 4 pieces in less than 20 minutes  at the same time i bought this i bought squirrel dude by busy buddy dog toys or something like that  and it has held up great <br  ><br  >i think the large original kong s would hold up well to my dog  but kong quest is a joke 
product	very expensive for a cat treat that none of my cats would eat 
quality	all canned food is stinky  but this is particularly so  also  due to the large amount of   34 gravy   34  there is considerably less   34 meat  34  in the cans  the cats finally got used to it when they realized nothing better was coming there way  but they never cleaned their dishes the way they do with the fancy feast seafood 
product	it came without instructions and it is not clear how one opens this  if at all  to put the kibble in  as a result  it is useless 
quality	too many seeds the chickens were not interested in <br  >disappointed 
quality	tried to wean my cat off the expensive hills prescription diet  i guess she is really finicky and just would not eat it at all  plus i am not super happy about the ingredients  i wish my cat was not so finicky and would eat better quality food 
quality	terrible product  smells like dog food  my cat hates it and refuses to eat it  most cats are picky at what they eat and if the food does not smell appealing they wont eat it  waste of money 
product	my cat truly hates this food  each and every flavor  it is a good thing i tried the variety pack first before wasting money on a big case  i tried this because of the low ash content and all the good reviews but my maine coon would have to be starving to death to eat this food  it is very watery  stringy and some of the flavors smell awful  the quality is questionable regardless of individual cat taste  the fussie cat variety pack is much more successful  but again every cat is different so it is just an expensive matter of trail and error 
health	my cat use to love these  he still does but now they give him diarrhea every time i feed a few  no other changes in his diet  was going to send back but it is probably less than  10 00  did not see a recall on these but did not want to take a chance on my baby  
quality	i thought this would be a great toy for my cat  the concept is good but  the box needs to be anchored down  i put treats inside it for her to fish out  the box slide al a round on my tile floor  she gave up on it and would not go near it again 
quality	very pungent aroma  my cat loves these but i recommend the chicken flavor 
health	i like the isle of dogs soft health treats for my dogs with live kidney disease since they are relatively low in protein and it says organic on the package  the package for these biscuits of the health line has no mention of being organic  also   protein is 11 in the picture on the amazon website but 9 on the actual packages received  were they manufactured at different places  one major negative is the clear plastic bag containing the biscuits had been broken upon arrival  thus losing freshness 
product	love this product when bought elsewhere  petco   they were moist and soft  and my dog loved them  unfortunately  when purchased through amazon  the product was hard and broke apart into dry bits  even though the expiration date had not yet passed  i am so disappointed because i wanted to subscribe to this item and have a package sent every month  i am going to give it one more try one  but then may be going back to buying them in store if the quality is still sub par 
product	there is nothing wrong with milo s dog treats  they are good and my dogs love them  but i am leaving this one star review so that amazon customers will be aware that some third party sellers are ripping them off <br  ><br  >be sure you check the price per ounce you are receiving  for instance  third party seller smile  n save sells this 2 7 oz  bag of dog treats for almost exactly the same amount of money that you pay for the 18 oz  bag of milo dog treats elsewhere on amazon  plus  they charge half again the price of the treats for shipping  it is a total rip off  i also think it is deliberatly misleading  customers see two bags of dog treats    the photos make the treats look like they are about the same size    and the price is almost exactly the same  but the flavor is different  so they order both bags  only one bag is huge and the other is the size of a sandwich bag <br  ><br  >totally not cool  check the price per ounce 
product	the antlers were large but my dog was able to chew one down completely in one day  this would lead me to believe these are not real deer antlers because it typically takes my dog  pitbull  months 
quality	my pooch is a picky eater  he is on a raw food diet  i have a hard time finding treats that he likes and that are healthy and made in the usa  after posting questions about this product  i decided to buy  i place the small square pieces in a puzzle for my pooch to navigate and find  he likes to eat them as a reward  but will not eat them if i try to feed them to him by hand  or roll on the floor  so that tells me they not absolutely delicious  just okay 
product	i bought these once in a store and my dogs went ape for them  they were a nice meaty texture like fresh smoked salmon  i bought this packet and i was so disappointed  worthless  they are like pork rinds   hollow airy and crumbly  messy  do not seem to have a great smell or taste  my dogs hate them   and they are worthless for treats  they crumble in my hand so they get one huge filet that they spit out and falls apart in their mouth  or they get dry crackly powder  will not buy again from here 
product	same as with other pet food cans  some were damaged and leaked on the others  a real mess 
product	a little pricey for what it is <br  >have seen any difference in the dog after 2 years of use 
quality	my guinea pig really did not care for it  i bought some other brands with dried fruits and veggies that he likes instead  it is a good price and i try to mix it in with the fruit one as a way to use it  maybe your pets might like it better 
quality	my dogs will not even eat these treats  they sniff them and walk away  even the one puppy who eats sticks will not eat them  i had to wrap them in cheese for them to eat a couple just to see if they would work  they didnt 
product	the item itself is fine  be very wary of subscribe and save  i have spoken to eight different people and have gotten nine emails and i am still not sure they have gotten the delivery dates and price right  they did not give me the discount price until i informed them of this  they also did not get the next delivery date right  also the internet site did not reflect the supposed corrections even though i informed them a day previously of a bug in the system  maybe they got it right this time 
product	this   34 puzzel  34  was horrible and i definitely consider it a waste of money  my non aggressive chewer shredded the plywood like construction 
quality	my  picky  yorkie would not eat these treats  but my neighbors yorkie loved them  ty 
quality	this is awesome smelling and looking food but my bird is not fond of it  not sure if he is just picky or what  i thought he would love it because he loves fruit but he does not eat much of it at all 
quality	i ate more of these than my dog did  they would not eat them      i do not get it  gave them to the neighbors       
product	it is smaller than i expected  and the lid is not really airtight  it is a nice looking treat dispenser  and i like that the inside is stainless steel the lid knob handle came dented 
health	this came recommended from an out of state friend  the ingredients seemed healthy enough and i wanted to like it  but it gave my dog chronic diarrhea  i even stopped it for a few weeks and let the stool return to normal  but when she restarted it  the diarrhea started again <br  >also  my 90lb labrador was able to swallow this stuff without even chewing because it is pea sized  too small for big dogs 
quality	the cats would not touch this for days  and when they finally gave in  the cat who has never thrown up as far as i know  was puking all over the house  i put it away  and went to buy a bag of their chicken formula with raw boost  thinking maybe it was a fluke we tried again when that bag was empty  and the same thing happened again  i have been leaving the leftovers outside for the feral cats in the neighborhood  but they do not want to eat it either  i do not know if it is just a bad batch or if there is something inherently weird about the formula 
product	bought 2 toys  had extremely strong chemical smell   was oily to the touch  soaked in hot soapy water for hours and the smell did not go away  threw out the toys  was not worth the health risk 
quality	horrible   very very stinky  dog not interested in them at all  i was surprised at the dog s reaction <br  ><br  >i did not like the smell  they are very tough  hard as a rock  not like the tracea chews that i got from another company 
health	my 4 lb pomeranian did not take to this food  she would throw up her whole stomach of food after dinner 
product	i love my cats  i am always searching for things to make them happier  or in this case  healthier  i purchased hills almost two weeks ago and slowly weaned them off of their old food  for the past week both of my cats have been constipated and look noticeably larger  not to mention they cannot stand the taste of the food  please do not buy this 
quality	too big for my 43lb dog  she was not interested and she loves rubber toys
product	i did not realize that this does not kill ticks  only fleas  so my cats had ticks all summer long  will not buy again 
quality	i do not like this because my cat  who only eats friskies canned food  will not eat it  have to give them away 
product	this buyer and her dogs are not impressed  this bone has almost no marrow  the most important part of the bone gnawing experience  considering the price  that is unconscionable  yes  it keeps the dogs busy for the short moments they bother with it  the bone  however  is promptly discarded and forgotten when a carrot enters the scene  i am under strict orders to never buy this particular item ever again <br  >i won t 
product	absolutely not worth the money  no where does it tell you in the description how many elk antlers you receive   23 95 you get one half of a split antler and 2 pcs of beef tendon so thin you could read the newspaper looking through it 
product	product arrived damaged and cans were dented  some were cracked open  could not use 
health	please read the label  this product is made in china  both my dogs loved these  ate it all up and 24 hours later  i was cleaning up messes all over the house  they were sick   after 48 hrs  they came around and since i had not figured out it was these  it had just been christmas and figured they got into something  i gave them another one   again messes all over  my youngest dog got it the worse  i started doing research and bam these went in the trash asap  i fell like the worst mother ever  please do not get these or give them to your dog  china products are killing our dogs 
product	sadly  our dog did not like them at all  spit out the first try  and then would sniff and turn away any other time we tried to give him one  rather than return them  we have given them to a friend to try with their 2 dogs  hopefully there will be a different outcome  we were very disappointed after all the great reviews 
health	my cat loves these and all the other greenies treats  but they have done nothing to help with his hairball problem  i have since moved on to more potent remedies in hopes that they work better 
quality	dogs went crazy at first but now they will not eat them anymore    
product	the package looked like it was 20 years old   but my hamsters love them nonetheless  and it is cute hearing them crunch on  em   whatever they are 
product	i bought these for our poodle mix  she will not even eat them  they say they are irresistible  obviously my dog cannot read  now i am stuck with a large 96 count box  bag   hopefully one of the neighborhood dogs might like them  what a waste of money  my daughter has been wanting to get these ever since seeing them advertised on wheel of fortune  i suggest trying a sample somewhere first before buying
product	terrible quality product  dog chomped it to pieces on first try     do not buy this     junk   
product	i purchased this item in april  it is now december and it is no longer working  i take good care of things so there is no reason for this to have stopped working  i am trying to contact the company but can not find contact information on their website      it is too expensive of an item to stop working in only a few months of use 
product	cheaply made  water does not really stay fresh and food does not come out very easily
quality	my 2 yr  old lab would not go near it   i wobbled it around on the floor  showing him what was inside  and when the treat fell out  he jumped about a foot in the air and took off across the kitchen floor   i could not stop laughing  i sent it back and amazon credited my account immediately 
health	did not do anything the reviews said it would  actually  i think it made the dogs ear infection worse 
product	my dog loves this treat  unfortunately  the yummy chummies package was already open when it arrived and i do not have the option to return so will be throwing them away  also noted that the treat did not state it was made in the usa 
quality	dog did not like this at all   he is been eating it just fine  but now that we ordered it from amazon he will not eat it  not sure if something is wrong with this batch 
product	the biggest thing i noticed is that the   34 belt loop  34  would only fit on a belt that is quite narrow  possibly less than 1  34   so the loop is not a selling point or convenient feature  the pouch is ok  but seems pricey for what you get  the clip has not broken yet  but i have only had it a short time 
health	the cat loves it  i do not love the red stains it leaves when she hacks up hairballs 
health	the cat loves it  i do not love the red stains it leaves when she hacks up hairballs 
product	disappointed to see 2 3 of the tub was tiny pieces or powder  i usually order the beef liver and it is an exceptional product  this product not eligible for return because it is a food item  but amazon did refund my money anyway 
product	it gets one star only because at least it rolls  the recorder will not work  the hole is much too big and all treat fly out easily  i highly recommend you not buy this ripoff and quietly let them go out of business​ like they should 
health	add another cat owner to the list of people that is disgusted with this new formulation  i had been feeding my cat orijen and wanted another brand to mix in with it  i saw the great reviews for wysong epigen 90 and a recommendation for it on a natural cat food blog so i gave this a try  i mixed a little in slowly with his current food and he really seemed to like it  as i mixed more in though over a week or two i noticed his stools were not very solid  eventually his stool was liquid and had an excessive amount of mucus  there was even a little blood in it  i took him to the vet and he was given cerenia  i was told to give it 48 hours and see if it improved  it did not improve  while waiting to hear from the vet i happened to look at the most recent reviews on amazon  that is when i saw a  cohn s review and it sounded just like the problems i was having with my cat  i stopped giving him the epigen and probably within 48 hours his stools had improved dramatically  from everything i have seen it sounds like wysong is continuing to defend this new formulation even after so many reports of the exact same problem from cat and ferret owners  do they really think it is just a coincidence  i am amazed at all these pet food companies that continually look for cheaper ingredients yet do not change the price of their food and put a lesser product out there that can harm our pets  thankfully a review on here saved me another vet bill and who knows  maybe saved my cat 
quality	hard as rocks  my cat could not eat these very well  i could not imagine how he could either  well  if your cat has great teeth and is young  maybe ok then 
quality	my 7 month kitten does not eat this food   she did not have any problem with other brands   the can is mostly filled with gelatin   i have not tasted it unfortunately  but seems it does not taste well for her   i have opened 3 cans so far  do not know what i can do with the rest of cans  
quality	it is claim to fame fail short very short  it took my terrior mix  60lbs dog about 3 minutes before it was on the way to little peaces  she chewed a large corner off quick and little effort  i am glad she does not eat them  i knew right then that my 95lbs shepard mix would have it completly devoured in no time 
product	they turn everything orange and my dogs were able to dislodge them from the toy in a matter of seconds  very disappointed 
health	ended up having to take my dog to the emergency after eating these treats  vet said treats had high dye content and dogs stomach could not digest the treats correctly 
quality	my bird does not care for it compared to other brands 
product	these are cute  cheap plastic jars  they are tall enough and large enough to hold a small package of pup peroni s  they are not worth this price  go to the dollar tree and save a bunch of money  i thought for this price they would be a hard plastic 
quality	my bird does not care for it compared to other brands 
quality	one of our dogs really likes them and the other will not touch it 
quality	kittens will not eat it  it may be very healthy but clearly not tempting 
quality	the smell is killing me and my ferret refuse to eat it  he preffer yogis then bandit
health	my cat gets constant upper respiratory infections and needed these to help boost his immune system  i used to buy them from the vet and they were crunchy and then i found them on anazon cheaper so i bought them here  when i got them they were different   smaller snd soft treats  my cat is super picky and will not touch any soft treats   so he will not eat them  i thought it was just a mistake buying from amazon so i reordered from my vet  and the new bag i got from them was also the newer soft version  he used to love them but now hates them so i had to order the powder to sprinkle on their food 
product	the packaging could have been better  but i also have to question the quality of this item since it arrived broken   3 times 
product	these were broken a lot and made it impossible for me to use them in gift bags as i had intended to do  so i was very disappointed 
quality	stink really bad  but my dog sure seems to like them 
product	i have two of the west paw bumi s for my dogs  i left another review about those  my apbt mixes had this broken up in less than an hour  much less durable than the bumi  strange as it seems  the legs do not stay together either  and for what it is worth  the one i received came in incredibly beat up packaging with scuff marks all over it 
quality	scary info on line    only 87  digestible  after reading that claim  i threw away a brand new box that had just arrived 
product	picture looks much nicer that the actual product     which is more like a cheap made in china product  the lid is actually flimsy plastic  that arrived with many scratches  and does not fit properly  there are better choices available for the money imho 
product	super thin  my 15 pound dog can eat one in 10 minutes  a good thick bully stick will last her many days with chewing an hour or so per day  i will not buy these again  i just got a pack of 6  34  jumbo bully sticks from downtown pet supply and they are huge   get some from them instead 
quality	this would be a great item if it was made out of something sturdier than cardboard  both my young cats loved it and stayed totally fixated on it until they cleared it of the treats  it was sturdy enough to withstand their weight  but not their teeth  within 3 uses  they managed to chew open the holes large enough to get their heads inside  what they could not eat directly all fell out when they turned it upside down  if it ever comes out in plastic  i will definitely get one   otherwise i am not sure i would be up for a weekly subscription 
product	was really disappointed when i received this product  i thought this was going to be jerky as stated in the title of the product  but it is just tiny bite size pieces of alligator  most of the product had crumbled to almost dust during delivery i am assuming  product is very smelly as well   difficult to get the smell off of your hands  on a positive note   my dogs did really seem to enjoy it  too much hassle to deal with for two large dogs  would be better as something crumbled over their food than as a treat in my opinion 
health	horrible product   will never purchase these every again    dog hated them   you may as well give them a chicken bone to choke on 
health	my cat prefers the cheap food   much to my chagrin   she has never had a tempermental stomach but started vomiting with this  i did mix it with her regular food in increasing ratios but when she went purely on this it did not agree with her  just my experience  the food itself smelled good and i know this is a quality manufacturer that uses better ingredients than her cheap food which apparently she prefers 
quality	worked the first time then the jig was up  now my cats will not touch them even without a pill hidden in them 
health	i miss being able to give them the more expensive food  but the budget is a little tight at the moment  and i thought this would be a great alternative     wrong  in real pet product reviews  this food places dead last  and if you can afford just a little extra  you can get them something at least middle of the road until your situation improves <br  ><br  >here are all the awful ingredients  so you do not have to hunt them up yourself <br  ><br  >ground yellow corn  corn gluten meal  poultry by product meal  meat and bone meal  animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols  form of vitamin e   soybean meal  animal liver flavor  phosphoric acid  calcium carbonate  salt  potassium chloride  oceanfish meal  albacore tuna meal  salmon meal  yellowfin tuna meal  crab meal  dried seaweed  choline chloride  taurine  zinc sulfate  added color  yellow 5  yellow 6  red 40  blue 2   ferrous sulfate  manganese sulfate  vitamin e supplement  calcium phosphate  niacin  vitamin a supplement  calcium pantothenate  copper sulfate  thiamine mononitrate  riboflavin supplement  vitamin b 12 supplement  pyridoxine hydrochloride  folic acid  vitamin d 3 supplement  calcium iodate  biotin  menadione sodium bisulfite complex<br  >menadione sodium bisulfite complex<br  >  9733   9733   9733  standard source of vitamin k activity  necessary for blood clotting  aids as anti parasitic for intestinal worms <br  >  source of vitamin k activity   sodium selenite 
product	as far as my dogs are concerned  they loved this stuff  me  not so much  there was not one   34 strip  34  of jerky in the package  it is more like shredded beef bits  some pieces were too small to even give as treats  sorry zuke s   we will not be buying this again 
quality	dog took one sniff and walked away  even with it loaded with dried liver bits which he loves  does not move easily  he does love treat balls  but not this 
quality	my beardie did not like this very much  it smelt horrible  i do not blame him for not eating it 
product	birds do like this product  the pieces are quite large  like for a macaw and the amazons i have are rather dainty and the very large pieces end up all over is their way to protest    was disappointed as it was more expensive than the fruit product and those pieces are small 
product	excellent quality bird seed  but i only received one package out of 6  i am contacting amazon  hopefully they can resolve this asap 
quality	i am not very fond of this toy as a treat dispensing toy because the hole is not adjustable and quite large  the food comes out very quickly  but  this ball is excellent for playing fetch with  i have a 14 week 5 lb pomeranian puppy who loves to play fetch with it because it is easy for him to grip in his teeth 
health	really small and must be careful that your dog does not choke on this  not really a long term chew toy
product	buyer beware   this item is extremely over priced because you get 24 of the 3 oz  cans   not the 5 5 oz cans  so basically  you get the 3 oz  can for the price of a 5 5 oz can  i feel cheated 
product	cats loves the treats  but only received one package  thought i was getting twelve 
product	my dog just wanted to take out the red parts and chew on them <br  >if they were made out of something indestructible that would be ok <br  >they are not <br  >a waste of money 
product	my russian tortoise gagged and spit this stuff out   he hates this stuff   and of course it would have to be expensive and a lot of it  i am thinking about returning it  but it will probably cost me more in shipping than it is worth  i do not recommend this 
quality	bunny would not touch it  had to go out and buy something different 
product	i do not know why my dogs do not love these  but they just are not going for them  i am disappointed because i trust smokehouse and they love other smokehouse products  there are other products with chicken wrapped around an edible tendon or rawhide on the market and because their favorite comes from china  i am resisting buying the and have been looking for a good  nutritious alternative  unfortunately  this is not it 
product	very slow delivery     it turns out my dog was allergic to this stuff
product	i would not buy it again  i tried it on my older lab for about six months with no results 
quality	i have puppy arriving today and i just opened the box with the dog food  there a big slit in the bag  i was not anticipating ordering stale  possibly contaminated dog food especially at the price i paid  i am not happy right now and i do not exactly have time to send it back seeing how i need to go out and buy more  i want a refund or a new bag asap 
health	gave my pup s upset stomachs and diarrhea  i would order these again and will donate these and others to the humane society loo
product	never had catbox odor issues until using this food  will not buy again 
product	have two dogs including a labrador who eats anything     except neither dog likes these  returning the unopened packages 
product	this is a terrible product  maybe it was just a quality control issue <br  ><br  >this item came with good packaging but when opened bugs flew out  it also had a bad  very unpleasant smell like overstored stale food although it was printed use by sometime in 2015  will trash it since the item cannot be returned  i will stay with other u s  made products for our pet 
quality	the pieces were too hard and big for my small maltese  she is 11 years old and has lost some of her teeth  so i had to return the product 
product	i have been buying this product for over a year  i love that they are limited ingredient treats and my dog loves them too  in the past few months i have been receiving the product in unacceptable condition  almost all of the dog treats inside the bag are in pieces  it literally is a back of crushed dog treats  i do not know whether the issue is with the company that makes them or how amazon is handling the product  though i doubt even the most careless of amazon workers would be able to crush and cause the amount of damage there is to the dog treats without destroying the bag  i am currently searching for a new limited ingredient dog treat 
quality	the pieces were too hard and big for my small maltese  she is 11 years old and has lost some of her teeth  so i had to return the product 
health	while researching this product and reading reviews i found it contains ingredients that could cause cancer
product	while both my dog and cat love these  the fact is that only about a third was useful  the rest were tiny or dust  they are not cheap  either <br  >the beef livers by stewart are terrific  i wish those were a bit more uniformly cut  but very little was dust <br  >i d prefer to use chicken  my dog in particular likes the chicken version and as we agree still training her  using something she really enjoys helps with that task immensely  that does not work with dust  these would be expensive if all of the product was usable   the price is ridiculous when only one third is 
quality	my puppy loves the treat  but then his stool is incredibly soft and smells bad when he eats this  i have removed this from his treats and his bowels are back to normal now 
quality	unfortunately my girls will not eat it  it smells good  the hay looks good  they just want nothing to do with it 
quality	my cat that eats everything will not eat not one  i read all the reviews they all said it was great  but not for me 
product	my dog is uninspired and cannot really use in leash training time  they take too long for my border collie to chew 
quality	my cats are not very interested  it was a waste of money for me 
product	first of all let me say i only feed my 12 year old dachshund   34 oscar  34  and my 4 month old kitten   34 bugg  34  blue buffalo products    this is the 3rd  time i have purchased jolly joints chicken jerky treats on amazon and with much disappointment the last  the treats are so hard they actually snap loudly when i bend them    i m afraid they will tear his stomach or intestines up  seriously they are so hard he cannot even chew them  i tried to break them up in smaller pieces and they got stuck in his teeth and tore his gums up  they are usually very moist and a perfect treat for any age dog  i feel safe to say that this is amazon  34 s fault for not storing them correctly   i called blue buffalo and they were very polite but we checked each package { i purchased 5 } by the exp  date and lot numbers  they were fine on blue buffalo end so it had to be the way they were being stored  i love amazon and i am a disabled individual who depends and very much appreciates online shopping especially with amazon but as i said with great disappointment i will no longer purchase jolly joints chicken treat   amazon  
quality	my beagle did not care for these at all  i was surprised  i do not know if it is the smell or the texture  but he quickly turns his head  totally not interested  which is unusual for a beagle since they are food motivated  i thought these has a nice square shape and size  about 1x1 and 1 8 inch thick  they smelled good to me 
product	neither one of my dogs will eat these  i gave them to a friend  but not sure if his dog is eating them  they love cheese  so i thought they would like them  wrong again  i guess they were not expensive enough to please them  so snooty   picky 
health	i usually purchase these identical treats at walmart for slightly over  12   and they are not old and petrified like the 3 bags i purchased here on amazon  they were so dry my small dogs could not choke down the   34 cremated  34  strip of   even after i attempted to revive and rehydrate them with a 4 hour h2o soak  rediculous 
health	this cat food is meant for cats with chronic kidney disease  when i first received it  my cat gobbled it up like it was the best thing ever  now  she doesn t  however  that does not mean that it is a bad food  she still eats it  but  not as she did when i first got it 
product	this is a great product when you buy it elsewhere  mine arrived dried up and crumbled up  but i have been buying it for yeqrw in the pet store and find it to be an outstanding product  i will not buy it from here again 
quality	sorry   i know some dogs love these  but my beagles would not touch them and normally they will eat anything  the smell is really strong 
product	my dogs really love these chicken strips  but i am really concerned about them being made in china  they are also pretty small 
product	not for betas or for me <br  >first  the package was almost impossible to get open  it has a push down child proof top with a foil seal underneath so the top would not push down  i pried it off  then the foil had no pull tab so i scraped it up with my nail  ruined my polish   finally when the foil pulled off  dried worms flew everywhere <br  >second  the product is disgusting <br  >third  my beta hated this  he tried to take a bite but it was too big for his mouth  i cut some more into tiny pieces   he took one bite and spit it out  this is the first time i have ever had to try to remove uneaten food from the tank  now it looks like i will have to charge the water <br  >fourth  this was a waste of money since my guy was still hungry  he gobbled up his aqueon pellets <br  >this is just a poor product all the way around  i would never purchase this product again and would warn all beta   34 owners  34  to stay away 
health	not really sure but actually think my dog got sick from these  it was the only things new in his diet
quality	no  i have been buying this product for the past year   my dog has always loved them  i purchased 4 bags  almost  50 00  of treats and my dog would not eat them  they were not at all like my other purchases   they were dry and very hard  i ended up having to throw them away 
quality	this one and the salmon chicken get thrown out cats will not touch smells funk dog
quality	chin does not like these  this is the only treat we have found that she turns her head away from 
health	at first  my dog loved it  however  he has the worst  most horrendous gas  and not just gas  he seemed really uncomfortable  sick and i strongly believe it was for no other reason but from these   34 treats  34   like i said  he loved them  i guess the smell or the taste of them  i do not know  i did not try them    and they smell pretty bad to me his gas was so much worse     but  i thought he liked them and thought they were made in usa  but after reading the other reviews  who really knows  many companies do the wrong thing  and all they care about is their bottom line  and this was my second bag i ordered  no more  back to his other treats  all natural  healthy and safe treats  no more deadly gas   i equate these too processed  greasy   34 chicken  34  nuggets  that children used to love  but caused a bevy of stomach issues  after an investigation revealed what was actually being put into the makings of those nuggets  that known company knowingly knew it was feeding that garbage to human beings  children  major changes were made     i suggest if the makers of milos wants to put their consumers first  they will be transparent to all involved with the manufacturing of these   34 treats  34   and find out and make aware to the public the number of pets that have become sick in some capacity as a result of pet owners buying this product and giving it to their beloved pets    if you will not eat it  try it for yourself  do not feed it to your dear pets  i just hope it is just bad gas and he is on the mend  and nothing more serious  i will be bringing him and these treats to my vet nxt week just for my own peace of mind  that he is ok 
product	smells really bad  dogs are okay with it but have had better toppings on their food  smell makes you want to gag  will not buy again 
health	i have been feeding these to my three dogs for over a year  i have a small rescue terrier mix  who is now old  and has had to have most of her teeth pulled  i saw her swallow the treat whole  so i decided to break it up so she would not choke on it  i bit into it  and all i could taste is sweet  i looked at the ingredients  and the number three ingredient is sugar  into the trash 
quality	my pup loves the treat dispensing toys  but i think this one was too hard for him  he has never shown interest in the pickle  even with zeeks mini treats stuffed into it 
product	i made a search for rawhide made in the usa or brazil  this item came out and when i received i discovered it is<br  >made in china       amazon should specify that  i will send it back
product	my dog loves the food   however  i did not love the fact that half of my cans were damaged and i had to throw a couple out due to mold 
health	not helpful with our  yeast  ear infection  better off flushing with hydrogen peroxide and then medicating 
product	do not go by the picture in the add  approx  1 3 of the ones in the package i received were the diameter of pencils   a rip off and i received no satisfaction from best <br  >buy other brands       
quality	the smell is too fishy  and my dog does not eat it at all 
quality	i love these dog chews but not when they come full of bugs  i rec vd them 30 oct and immediately placed the boxes in our roller container for dog treats  a short while later  i opened a box and found little black bugs inside the box  i normally do not like to leave a negative review  however  there was no way i could find to contact the seller and let them know privately of the problem  i just thought you should know  we had to throw away a lot of dog treats because the bugs went from the boxes of these chews into the entire treat container  it was horrible   so sorry to leave this as a review 
health	my friends suggested we try these for our two small dogs  we wanted fresh breath and help in keeping their teeth clean  within the first week  and only one greenie each a day  both dogs were vomiting and eating grass constantly  needless to say  we discontinued them immediately  i have no idea why this happened  but they do not agree with our pups  we will not be buying these again 
quality	not great very light my dog did not care for them
product	this treat ball does not really hold in kibble very well  the holes are too large to make it challenging for my dog  once she manages to flip the ball over  it just dumps out on the floor all at once  sending it back 
product	i probably will not re order  my goats were not too excited about this one  it is packaged alright but for it to be a treat they showed no preference for it 
health	got my dog so sick  she was vomiting and having diarrhea all night 
health	my cat needs this due to urinary tract problems  i am pretty sure it must taste awful because he does not eat it nearly as fast as his old food and he loves his food  but  i guess the alternative for the cat is to die 
product	quality of the sticks were not uniform  dog consumed them within a few days  overall i consider the product to expensive for the enjoyment they provide to our puppy 
quality	i see many pet stores selling these  and the price is right here on amazon  but my cats do not like them 
health	our dogs liked this at one point  after time  they seemed to only like the meaty bits  also  at some point  it looks like they changed the formula  the hard bits looked different  and the meaty bits looked less   34 meaty  34   and the dogs no longer finished the food in their bowls  ended up switching foods as we have an obese dog  switched to a   34 fat dog  34  blend   and our other dog is getting old  so starting using a food focused towards older dogs  joint and brain nutrition   would have gave more stars if they did not change their formula  note this does not reflect on the seller  food always arrived on time and as described  seller is good  food quality and our particular use case changed 
product	we were very disappointed to find that this is just a cardboard box  for that price  we expected something better  the first time we gave it to our cat  he got all the treats out in a couple of minutes  i was about to send it back  but we tried again and it took him longer  i am not sure if it is a toy or a frustration for him 
quality	our teddy bear hamsters do not like these  ended up giving them away 
quality	the treats arrived as hard as a rock and my cat refused to eat them like that  it is almost as if they had gone bad 
quality	got damaged during shipping  the food was old and had a very bad smell 
product	ordered 5 bottles on november 24  2014  delivered on november 28  2014  opened package   all 5 bottles expired on 04 2013  selling expired supplements 
quality	i bought this for my cats who usually eat 9 lives  friskies was cheaper  they do not care for it  back to 9 lives  cats eating again 
quality	not the companies fault but my dog will not eat them 
product	i researched environment friendly cat litter options  this was the top  and cheapest  option  it is made of recycled newspaper and it comes in tiny little sticks  very different from the pebbles of typical cat litter <br  >i followed the suggestions of others and traded out my old litter for this over a few weeks   to get him used to it <br  >he did not like it  he just pooped on top  which smells <br  >i ve tried a few times and it is not working <br  >also  when he urinates into it  it just turns an entire section soggy  which you learn to spot pretty quickly but does not really look that different  and is really different from clumping litter  this is easy to accidentally mix the soggy litter in with the clean and separate 
quality	the product itself is a solid kong toy  but for some reason my dog does not have any interest in playing with it  i am hoping she changes her mind since i have heard lots of good things about it 
product	i was sure when i ordered this product i ordered a 12 or 16 count and i received it  it was a six count and was very expensive for a six count big bones but i have a little dog
product	very disappointed  after reading the good reviews  thought i would try it  within 2 weeks fleas were back big time  used on both of my dogs and they both have fleas back 
product	i feel a bit unfair posting this review  but nevertheless this is my experience  apparently  i have a very stupid cat and an extremely food motivated pug  the package arrived  and i promptly gave it to my fiancee to figure it out   after all  it was my cat brains i wanted to test and train  not mine  my fiancee eventually found an assembly picture somewhere in the back and folded the box as instructed  i put some treats in  the cat looked at it and sniffed it  and even meowed a few times  but apparently we feed him too well  because he never got motivated enough to solve the puzzle  i put the toy on the top shelf of his three story cat condo <br  >our pug  however  showed some interest  he is usually very lazy and sleepy for most of the time except for the occasions when food is involved   there was no way for him to get to the toy much to his dismay <br  >in three days  when we were at work  apparently  some sort of negotiation took place  and when we came back  the box was on the floor  the puzzle solved in the most violent way by being torn to pieces by pug`s teeth  and all the treats were gone  since the pets were not talking to each other  i assume that the whatever agreement they had was broken  and it was the pug who got all the treats  so it did not work for me  hence two stars 
product	little disappointed with the way it is designed  does not hold much and treats do not stay in it 
health	i bought this for my 5 5lb young cat  7 months  not realizing it was for adults since this is not listed in any of the product details  i am a first time cat owner  so that was partly just my own ignorance  however it should be specified somewhere other than the picture  anyway  my poor cat has had diarrhea for weeks to no avail with medications  so we are switching to a different brand  the reviews indicate this is a good product  so we may just be having a bad experience    
product	the lip inside the whole was so small that even i had trouble shaking the treats out of it  i ended up cutting the hole out so it is not totally useless  but i was disappointed with the design 
product	the dog seemed to really like them but the container is much smaller than it appears  making it very pricey indeed 
quality	update to previous review <br  >i have started ordering this jerky solely from barkshop and no where else  we tried it twice from amazon and both times the jerky was hard and crunchy  every time we get it from barkshop now it is soft and chewy  just the way our pup likes it  if i were to review this product on barkshop it would get 5 stars  on amazon not so much  it seems they are getting the not so great quality bags <br  ><br  >previous review <br  >i am thoroughly disappointed with this product  when i received it in my pup s barkbox it was a soft jerkey  not crunchy or hard  and very easy to break apart  my pup does not like hard or crunchy treats  only soft or chewy treats  this jerky is on the high priced side and the only reason i ordered it was bc my pup loved the soft jerkey from his barkbox  the same brand and flavor i ordered from amazon arrived and was rock solid  hard  crunchy and even hard for me to break apart into smaller pieces for him  somone at the brand needs to do some quality control on their product  i will never order this again and would not recommend it to anyone  jerky is not supposed to be hard and crunchy at all   
product	purchased was supposed to be ten 2 1 oz  packages  only received one 2 1oz  package description says ten 
quality	dogs love this from the store  but for some reason when this arrived  twice  it was dry and nasty and they would not touch it  it was within use by date  had to cancel auto delivery 
health	fergus my plump puss was not crazy about this but he ate it  i did not notice any weight loss due to the fact probably that he gets canned food with gravy too  at any rate he did not gain any weight 
quality	my dog chewed it up and it broke off in little pieces  he did not eat the little pieces so it was a mess  i do not think i would buy this again 
product	sometimes it works sometimes it doesn t  i do not really think it is good for dogs because its ingredients contain a systemic pesticide 
product	i was hoping this would last longer  it was worn down very quickly  i probably would not buy this product or related ones again 
product	the product arrived sealed and the expiration date is jan 2016  but the treats were stale and hard and did not smell like fish  i wanted a replacement  but the only option amazon gave me was a refund and a label to send it back  it is getting harder and harder to find a link on amazon to email a person and tell them what you want  every link these days takes you to pre printed faqs  so whatever   i will return it and get a refund and i will not order this product again because without the option to get a replacement  i am left to assume this particular item will always be stale  i am disappointed with the product and amazon on this one 
health	made my dog vomit every time she had one  i tossed them  she has never gotten ill from any other treats or dog food 
product	my dog likes them pretty well  but i will probably not buy this brand again  the smell is pretty strong and lingers in my yorkies beard  did not have this problem with a previous brand 
quality	this chicken jerky was old and my dog will not eat it  thanks but no thanks
product	too expensive and ferret did not even like it  a vet recommended it 
health	the second time was not a charm  ordered this two times as  salmon  treats and two times it was rabbit treat  not really satisfied  hope you get your numbers corrected  thank you
product	i did not realize  but the treats are much larger and they are tough to break  fine for large dogs  but i have cocker spaniels  the ingredients are healthy 
quality	some of this food is just down right disgusting to serve  if you are looking to serve your cats actual animal guts then this is the food for you <br  ><br  >my cats really did not care for it at all 
product	i have always liked using science diet when it comes to my dogs and i would recommend this to anyone  i was a little upset with this last delivery  the box had the side torn and when i opened the box to pull the dog food out their was a big hole in the side of the bag where their was the hole in the box  you know as much money as i spend on dog food i do kind of expect it not to arrive in a disarray and who knows how much food was lost before i opened the box 
quality	i do not believe that my betta fish is a picky eater  since he has eaten and enjoyed every other brand of food i have given him without hassle  however  he will not eat this food  no matter which variety i give him  he comes up during feeding time and smells it then backs away  leaving it untouched  i had to buy another brand and this one got thrown in the trash 
product	the quality of the food was what i expected  so no disappointment there  based on the photo of the package provided  and the description   34 big bites  34   i was expecting a bag of all large pieces of yogurt covered fruit  in reality  there are very few pieces of large fruit  and a lot of tiny yogurt covered pieces of fruit  i was hoping to use them as   34 treats  34  as the package also states  but will now have to mix them with my parrot s food since the pieces are too small to give him individually  wish there would have been a better picture of the actual treats provided 
product	my chinchilla loved pulling the wooden ties off and she loves chewing on the sticks once she is separated then  but it makes her cage a mess  all those sticks get under the bedding and she shves them into her potty corner    i do continue to buy them because she does seem to really like them  but now i remove 80  of the sticks once she is separated them and add them back as needed  one of these days i am going to realize the hassle is not worth the few minutes of fun she has disassembling it 
health	i cannot believe ellen makes this product since it contains carageenan  which is linked to ibs and cancers  carageenan does not contribute to taste  it s only used as a thickener and emulsifier  why not use another product  ellen  i cannot believe i bought this without checking the ingredients first  but i assumed  wrongly  that ellen would not use stuff like this in her pet foods  shame on you 
quality	if i had posted this review a few weeks ago it would ve been a 5 star one  however  the last time i ordered one of these bars it came completely white  not beige  and had a horrible smell to it  to be clear  i have purchased close to five of these bars in the past and have never had any problems with them  we absolutely loved and raved about them    i called paras pets and the lady on the phone was very helpful and offered to send a new bar as a replacement  a few days later  today  the new bar arrived and it was even more white than the first one was  it felt dried out and rough  unlike every other bar i have ever purchased from them  i decided i must have been mistaken about how it was supposed to look and gave the medium bar to my jack russell terrier who is previous medium bars have always lasted him months  it took him one bite to snap the bar and take off a few crumbly pieces  i took it all away from him to inspect the bar and noticed that it was all flakey  dried out  and much lighter than the usual medium bars  not at all the same texture as before  i was sure  i called paras pets again and this time i got the brush over from the lady on the phone who said that not all bars are the same and that this was totally normal  it seems to me that they are just sending out old bars in an effort to get rid of them  i will be purchasing one more bar to give it one last chance but i doubt i will be buying any more from paras pets anymore  i will be switching to the himalayan dog chews from now on which is a shame because we used to rave about this product to all of our pet owning friends 
product	the cats love this  and i think the price is fair  but i had to cancel my subscribe and save because three months in a row the package arrived dented  this was not a small dent  nearly every can had been dented significantly 
quality	my dogs do not like it at all  they smell it and then run away  i doubt the ingredients of the bones  they just ignore it  i felt i lost money and get nothing from it 
quality	my dog loves the beef variety  petchup  but for some reason is completely indifferent to this flavor  he is a picky eater and eats slowly so after trying a multitude of different foods from high end to supermarket inexpensive  i tried the petchup  which he liked  he actually ate his food  i thought i would pick this flavor up to give him some variety but he turned his nose up  it is probably just him being finicky but i will be sticking with the beef for future purchases 
health	these were great at first  however  one of my dogs became ill with gi symptoms  vomiting and loose stools  upon checking the blister pack that the treats came in it was noticed that these were manufactured in china for the company  i called and spoke with a representative and they do offer the same product   34 made  34  in the usa and not processed or anything else in china  they exchanged the products that i had for their usa treats  when are we going to stop importing dog and cat treats  toys from china  several friends pets have suffered untoward effects  i e   pancreatitis and gi problems from chinese imports 
health	my bunny loves it  however bunnies are not supposed to have pine shavings and the front label was clearly misleading  i cannot continue to let my bunny chew on these because in the end  they really could give him health problems  read up about bunnies and pine  not a good combination  do not give these to your rabbit  no matter how much they love them  find a healthy and safe alternative  
quality	dog will not eat them waist to buy them  soft treats are better at her age 16
health	my dog loves these  but her tummy doesn t  she always eats them too fast and gets loose stools  we have since found other similar treats that do not irritate her as much 
quality	my guiena pig would not eat this  had to throw v away
health	for the same price  assuming the price is 12 34 and not 13   which i paid  i could purchase about 35 5 5 ounce cans at aldi  and my cats like aldi s cat food better  usually  they go crazy over canned food  but they seem minimally interested in this food   it might be because it is less substantive than other canned cat food  it is unusually watery with stringy pieces of whatever     in summary  this is not a good value and is not enjoyed by our household felines  update  only one of my two cats will touch this food  the one that eats this food will usually eat a whole can of other cat food  at least 5 different varieties  in one feasting  but he only picks at this food and will not eat it all at once  i guess the only good thing about this food is that it probably would not result in the obesity of my cats     given this and the price  i have to change my rating to 1 star because there is no option for 0 stars 
quality	my senior cat has stage 2 kidney failure  so i switched her over to kidney friendly food to help  she is a food lover and eats every meal like it is her last  but to my surprise she will not touch this  i do not know if it is because she just does not like the flavor or the fact that it smells   34 off   34  seeing all of these positive reviews had me get my hopes up for nothing  o 
product	this is the second time in eight years that we have had to deal with fleas on our indoor cats  this seemed to work for about two weeks but now we are seeing more fleas on the cats  hopefully the second dose does the trick  this is too expensive not to work 
product	i have been buying these bones for years now  and the last two packages i have ordered the bones have been very thin and light weight  of course the price has not been lower to compensate  unfortunately its a good size for my dog and i have not found a replacement yet 
product	my dogs love these  i cut them in half  it was a great deal  8 packs of 3 for  13 99 and free shipping  i almost clicked   34 buy it again  34   and so glad i paid attention since they increased the price to  62 99   5 25   count     6 49 shipping  i can buy them for  3 99 at my very high priced local grocery store  it was just a good deal and convenient to order on amazon <br  >i have 4 small dogs that can eat them in about 10 minutes even if i do not cut in 2 pieces  so the lower price of  13 99 was a nice deal for a treat  but they are not worth the new price 
health	i am gonna give it a 3 this thing was mammoth until i took the packaging off and the thing fell apart so the big knuckle of the bone had to be thrown out since it was in pieces and did not want my dog to choke on it so after taking all the lose pieces away this bone shrunk substantially smaller    
health	initially my dog loved these  we weaned him into the full dose over a week but after about day 4  he started throwing up a few hours after having one  he is got a pretty sensitive stomach but there was something about these treats that really made him sick  i am sure it was not the glucosamine that made him sick because he is had lots of other kinds without issue so it makes me wonder what else they are throwing in there  not worth having a sick dog  we will not be re ordering 
product	expensive for what you get although my dogs do love these and they are gone within 10 minutes so i will have to continue my search for a chew that ll last my 6lb chihuahua and 20lb mutt a bit longer as this would be a to big part of their feed if given regularly 
quality	this is the only treats my sun conjures will accept as well as my little pomeranian pup  and as a rule they are so soft and fresh  but i must have received a bad batch because only 1 bag of the many i ordered and received were dried out and hard and my birds nor my pup will eat them  as a rule these are the best treats ever    
product	who thought this was a good idea  my dog has always liked the treat balls where the treats fall out slowly as she plays with it  this rubber thing is ridiculous  the treat goes in and it does not come out  it just gets slimy and disgusting  my dog just tore the whole rubber cage thing apart  and fast  who knows how much of it ended up in her belly while she tried to get at the treat inside  what a waste of money  i am glad i did not order the refill treats in advance  there is no need for them  in fact  when i finally decided to take the treat out myself  my finger got stuck in the grommet in the end of the rubber bone  gross  i am very disappointed 
product	products ok   but they really jacked up the price  bought it last year twice from amazon and paid 34 00 for twenty each time  bought it just recently from amazon and paid 47 00  talk about dog inflation  anyway  will not buy again  hate getting ripped off 
health	these made our cat vomit a lot   she loved them  but   
health	i am on the fence about the current product  there seems to be more gravy with small bits and a little fewer big chunks compared to my previous order  2 months ago   even though the package still says 5 5oz  my cat still likes it  and has not had digestive issues  so i do not think there is an actual change to the product  but i am uncertain about the overall value compared to before 
health	made my dog super sick and had to take her to emergency vet 
product	they did not bother to box the case up  so many cans were dented and had to be tossed  that is not ok  
product	seamless transaction    quick delivery  product sizes do not match dog size  this toy is   34 tiny  34  and remains lost somewhere in the house  the puppy lost in in the first week  order larger sizes than what you think you need 
product	avoid this product on animals  gave it to my two dogs and now they have left ear twitching which indicates a form of toxicity since there is hyper neuro excitability  i had previously purchased advantage ii and i do not know why i did not buy that one again  i thought the pyrethrin would give an added bonus  but  this is not worth it 
quality	i probably will not order this again  worked in a pinch when i was out of their usual treats  it was hard and dried out  so it was either over processed or old  the best kind are when they are a bit chewy  but not overly so <br  ><br  >dogs did not care either way  but my little one would not eat them <br  ><br  >was looking for an alternative to dried duck  which is my dogs favorite  but can get a bit pricy on a weekly basis <br  >i use this as a reward for a quick  potty  outside  especially useful in the morning when they do not want to come in <br  ><br  >still on the lookout for a good subscribe and save option 
product	i do not believe this food is high enough quality to feed to any ferret but i ordered it to keep my new ferret s diet consistent while i slowly add in the more nutritious food  i think this food is one of the main contributors to ferret poor health  do not buy 
quality	my dog was not interested in playing with this toy  he is much more interested in his kong that he can throw around  without being able to pick it up and toss it himself he did not want to bother 
product	i did not realize that these would be   34 nothing  34  treats  they are freeze dried as opposed to dehydrated like i usually get  as a result they are paper thin and lite 
health	i have used bellyrubs chicken strips for about 10 years and through 4 dogs  and they were the  1 go to treat for my ultra picky chows  they used to be actual strips of thinly sliced  unprocessed natural chicken meat  dried to a pleasant crunch  or so it sounded   i verified with the  local  company that they were usa organic  and my dogs never had any problems with them  and adored them <br  ><br  >in january 2017 the bag i got was different    changed from irregular shaped  dried strips of natural meat to chopped pressed dried strips of all uniform size and thickness  i called again and was assured it was just a change of processing and subcontractor  and no change was made in quality of the 100  organic usa chicken  at first  my 2 chows seemed happy with them  but within a week or ten days the younger dog refused them occasionally  or took it reluctantly if i cut it in half    they were clearly much harder to chew  but he inhales bones  so it was not his teeth  i thought he was just being a prima dona  because older girl dog still seemed thrilled with them  and i did not mind that it took her longer to devour it <br  ><br  >a couple weeks later  one or the other dog started throwing up  between them 3 4 times a week    seemed random at first  and never at the same time  ok  i am slow  after 6 weeks of scurrying to clean up dog barf at all hours i finally realized that hard  undigested bits of the chicken stuff were often visible  even several hours after the last treat  i completely stopped giving them the chicken strips one month ago  and there has not been a single dog barf episode since that day  nothing else changed  so i am convinced that was the culprit <br  ><br  >sadly  these are really not at all the same high quality treat i would used for so long  and i will not be buying them again unless they go back to the previous style of naturally dried  plain chicken meat 
product	these will stain everything  and the company does not place any form of warning on the packaging  not cool   not cool at all 
product	awful   one of my labs had it torn apart in less than 5 minutes    and that was my completely non aggressive chewer   i can only imagine what would have happened if i had given it to my average chewer   sheesh   what a total waste of money   only the regular   34 old school  34  cone shaped kongs have held up for us    the rest of the kong products are just as chintzy as all the other companies toys  
quality	two of my cats do not like this at all but one will reluctantly eat it 
quality	i have two dogs  one small  11lb  and one medium  60lb   and the small dog will not touch them  the other dog  he will eat them if i do not offer him the store brand bones  i have tried 3 different times to see if the medium size dog will choose between the store brand bones and these p nuttier bones by putting both kind out in front of him  he did choose the store brand every time  who knows  it may take 6 months or a year for our dogs to ever get to liking them 
quality	usually my cat love the friskies cat food prime with ocean whitefish   tuna in sauce and would not eat anything else but the last case i ordered was spoiled my cat would not touch it  i can also tell there was something wrong with it by just looking at it  i believe you need some quality control  
quality	meaning my dog will not eat these strong flavored pill pockets
quality	sorry  my cat hated this  she would not eat or go near it  my neighbor though her cat loved them 
health	perhaps it is just my ferret but she vomited after chewing on the first one and has not tried a second one  i had to throw them out  i will stick with the n bones  those she likes 
quality	they were old  dried out   my little maltese will not eat them 
quality	the treats seemed great but my adopted 14 lbs llasa poo would not eat them and he loves nearly everything  i originally bought them based on the recommendations as a training tool but as they are sized bigger than his kibble and really hard  took him a long time to chew on just one treat  these do not break easily into smaller pieces like other similar sized treats  so i tried to give one as regular after walk treat but he would not eat it and left it in the bowl  i returned them <br  ><br  >likely better for a larger dog for treat training 
product	do not buy this product  it killed my beloved beagle  it is the only thing different he was exposed to and just days after his 3rd treatment he died of a massive seizure  i blame this product 
product	not overly impressed  our dogs hate any kind of attempted dental hygiene  so i am always trying different treat options that claim to help  honestly  most seem pretty similar and to not work near as well as advertised <br  ><br  >honestly cannot say that i saw any difference in these from the greenies brand or similar  even our little dogs devoured these in what seemed like minutes  i suppose you could argue that a longer test is needed  but these are more expensive than some of the other options and the results after one box were not noticeable to me 
quality	pups turned their noses away from these  also crumble a bit when trying to form around pill
product	my dogs love dried lamb lung  so we bought a package and kept them in an airtight container  tonight i go in and find that it is crawling with bugs that i have never seen before in our house  we have had the package for 3 weeks and i am worried about how many bugs i have fed my dogs  i am very unhappy with this purchase  the photo i attached is through the bottom of our snapware container because i did not want to open it in the house  there were little curvy worms and winged bugs 
product	dogs love it  but watch the packaging  sometimes i get 1 large bag  and the next month i get 3 large bags but no price change  must have supplier issues 
product	very disappointed with this product  my rabbits will not even eat it  since i cannot return it  i am stuck with 25 lbs of food i cannot use  i was thinking about donating it but i do not think other rabbits will like it either 
health	i am always trolling for new goodies for my hens  i like happy hen and was looking forward to treating my girls to a healthy snack  but i will have to agree with previous reviewers this is not really worth the money for the following reasons <br  ><br  >  the amount of seeds to everything else<br  >  lots of big sunflower seeds which my hens struggled to break open  many lay on the floor  uneaten  but not for lack for trying <br  >  lack of worms  which is why their may be a lot of black seeds <br  >  lack of good quality ingredients<br  >  the ingredients listed are cheap  you can get a lot of raisins and oats and seeds for this price <br  >  small  about the size of a hockey puck<br  >  expensive for what you get  overpriced for the size<br  ><br  >and the most important factor of all       my hens just did not like it  sure  they pecked with interest as they do anything i give them  but they did not stay interested and they did not stay around this seed cake except to bat it around  spread seeds that did not get eaten <br  >the sunflower seeds were the worst  very big seeds  my girls pecked and pecked at them and could not eat them  which is good because with that size i was afraid they would choke on them  so many seeds  after pecked off the cake  were left uneaten on the floor  but not for lack of trying  a bit disappointing as i do like this company 
health	one batch of these was contaminated with salmonella  it made my cats very sick 
quality	this toy was not everything i would hoped it would be and so much more  my cats just do not see the need to roll the little ball around  in fact  they do not like the noise it makes as it rolls across the hardwood floor  obviously  they finally figured out how to use it because there is only one treat in there  but they do not like it 
product	i give the greenies 3 stars because my dogs love them  i started buying them back in 2012 but i have only bought 2 box s this year because the price is just to high  i go to walmart once a month and stock up and treats for my pup s and the dog stuff is way cheaper up there     but they do not sell greenies there  you can get them at petco or pet smart but there just as much there as they are on amozon   maybe a little more costly
product	the size of the pieces was reduced to very very small and useless  i’ve been using this exact product for years and the packaging did not say the size of the pieces were reduced to tiny  i’d love my money back please   
health	while this little treat ball seems like a really cool idea to keep my dog busy  it has little plastic nubs around the outside of the ball where the top and the bottom screw together  my dog  and i can imagine other dogs might too  has chewed off many of those plastic nubs   and has swallowed them  the plastic is sharp  it can hurt a dog quite easily  this is a dangerous toy 
product	i have been using this on my dog for 7 years and i think this last batch i got is a bad batch  we spend lots of time in tick heavy woods and this only the second time i have found ticks actually alive and feeding on him  i put the first dose of this batch on him on dry friday and he did not get wet at any point afterwards  the following wednesday i found 3 well fed ticks firmly attached  on his neck near where i applied the product  the only other time this has happened  the pet store where i bought it actually told me it was a known bad batch i had purchased and swapped it for frontline  they were actually pulling all of that batch from their shelves when i went in to ask about it  
quality	my dog chew it for two day  i think she finished one piece and that was it  have not touch it again since   sigh 
quality	sadly my puppy do not like to chew on this  it is kind of cute to watch it spit it out  lol
health	my cat was doing great on the original epigen 90  but now that they have changed the formula to make it cheaper  her allergies are back and she has been having intestinal issues as well  i am taking her off the food and wrote wysong to ask them to please go back to the original healthy formula  it is such a shame 
quality	our dog did not like at all  our trainer told us that these treats have gone downhill since they got bought out by purina  not the quality they used to be 
quality	ugh  this smells like catfish bait  my cat sniffs them and stares at me with her eyes narrowed  she refuses to eat them  she has not even licked hem  the smell must be off putting to her as well  i guess  my cat has yet to be impressed by any of the   34 high end  34  or   34 better  34  brands of cat food and treats 
product	this is a very good quality dog food that i mix with a high protein quality kibble  my reason for the 3 stars is every subsequent order i received  more and more cans were dented  some to the point of creasing and had to be thrown away  i should have returned them but do find it a pain 
product	a little expensive for the amount you receive in the package  greenies tend to be priced high 
quality	i do not like this stuff  many lower quality ingredients  switched to   34 taste of the wild  34  instead and i am much happier with the quality 
quality	delivery was quick  thank you <br  >like that it is very watered down  however  he will not eat it  but laps up the juices 
quality	just like other reviewers said  my cats loved this at first  then stopped eating it  i cancelled my subscribe and save  i wanted them to like it  low carbs  high water content  and cheap <br  >it s a no go for us 
product	unfortunately this was a waste of money as it was easily destroyed by some chewing <br  ><br  >the premise is good  it was easy to fill and easy for our 8 month old walker hound to figure out  the downside was that within 20 minutes of rolling it around  he started to chew it and all too quickly there was a 2  34  hole on the side  thus  it is rendered useless and was a expensive way to pique his interest for a short period of time 
health	my daughter feeds her cats pro plan an they do fine but my cats vomited all the time they were on it
health	this product arrived well on time  sooner than i expected  my sick dog loves the taste of it  i would like to order more but i just cannot afford the price  almost 10 bucks for one 8 oz liquid food  too much for me  i wish the seller could slash down the charge for s h as it almost cost the same amount of the product 
product	bottle broke after a month of light use  the spout where water came out of broke off  very annoying   
product	i have bought this in the past which made me want to buy it again  the dogs loved them  i was very disappointed this time  they were very hard and the pieces were small almost like scrapes  not sure if i would order this again  
health	these made my newfoundland sick  do not waste your money or you will find yourself at the vet with a dog with blood in their stool  not fun 
product	i received the 2 cans one can s lid was completely broken  eventhough the package was in good condition  i use another brand  but because of the fleas i heard this one was great  when i sprayed both cans it didnot come out in a nice even strong spray it came out in a weak spitting spray i would never buy again     
product	my four month old puppy has treats out in 2 minutes  it is a waste of money 
health	i have 6 cats  don t ask   and one has terrible hairballs  another one of my kitties has chronic utis and eats the prescription canned urinary formula of the hill s science diet  that variety is very popular with most of my kitties so i thought the hairball version would be as well  unfortunately  none of my kitties like this  i ordered the minced chicken flavor and all my cats just turn up their noses  back to royal canin dry hairball food it is 
health	lousy purchase  these were not  soft and chewy  but dry  crumbly and hard  one of my dogs got terrible diarrhea after eating these  i am going to try and return get my money back  maybe they sat in the warehouse too long  not sure what the deal is  but i will not buy these again 
health	my dogs had really bad runs after eating this my corgie has pooped blood for 2 days we will be going to the vet tomorrow i am sick about this  i used one can will not use anymore of course i had to cut the hair off my white wirehair doxies butt<br  ><br  >this food made my dogs sick one is pooping blood i am not happy about this not sure what to do  i use natural balance dry food very good brand i am very pleased with this wholesome food it might just be the venison is too rich  i will not buy venison again 
quality	i cannot say that the product is bad per se  my kitten refuses to eat it 
health	this is made in china or taiwan and i cannot trust what ingredients are in it for my dogs  i returned it  it did not say in the info on amazon s site so i did not know ahead of time  too many dangerous pet products made in china   sorry 
product	more like   34 ear tips  34  for the most part     smallest cow ears i have ever bought and the individual wrapping in a bulk bag is annoying too 
health	these made my dogs sick   she retched and coughed for two days after switching to these from the ones that i bought at the local pet store  they do not even look like the original ones i had  i am not sure what is in them  but it is not just cornstarch
quality	we were so excited to receive this ball  which shipped quickly   thanks amazon  but quickly became very disappointed  our dog it not a chewer so the many reviews from those whose dogs chewed through it in 10 minutes was not an issue for us  also the awful smell that others complain of was not a problem for us either   has a faint hint of vanilla which the pooch did not mind at all  however  the poor design is a big problem  apparently some complaints about it being too hard to retrieve treats prompted a design change that made the treat dispensing hole bigger which made things way too easy  from what i can tell  this prompted yet another design change wherein a tall tube was created inside so that it is very difficult for treats to come out at all now  except while the tube is stuffed full of treats   otherwise  it is near impossible to get the treats out  it even took me awhile with some fine tweezers     and i am pretty sure our dog has not mastered using tweezers with one paw yet while he holds the ball steady with the other paw  the toy is not hygienic either  it is virtually impossible to keep clean  you can shake water in it  over even sudsy water  but with all the crevices on the inside  do not count on ever getting it clean  i do not hate anything so i could not give it one star since it works for a minute when stocked full of the right sized treats     but that makes for a very short game for my pup  nice try omega but this toy is just barely above barely useful  it seems yet another design change is in order 
quality	i  m very unhappy with this product  our pet guinea pig will not even touch this food 
health	my puppy choked on one of these    not easily digestable  would not recommend giving to anyones puppy  i threw these and the others away oh and my puppy is 4 months old     
product	the dried chicken packages contained a lot of crumbs  as if the package had been crushed  previous purchases of the same product were much better 
quality	my african grey parrot would not eat them at first because they are different from the regular flavor  now he loves them even more than his peanuts 
quality	they must have changed the recipe formula   my cats will not touch it and we have tried several cans out of the case we bought 
quality	it is what is advertised  but the water stinks after a couple days 
product	decent budget product  it is a cheap plastic ball that indeed dispenses treats  however even on the hardest setting it will dispense a treat every 5 10 seconds or so which is a little too fast for us  also the plastic is a little flimsy  the two halves screw together  but unfortunately if our dog runs the ball into a wall or hits it hard enough  the halves slip apart and our corgi gets all the treats at once  so apparent the iq of our corgi is pretty high <br  >maybe the bigger one is more durable  probably not  but it has not broken yet so ill give it 3 stars since it does entertain her for 30 min or so 
quality	another treat my cats will not eat  i gave it to the wild birds  they like dry cat food
product	advantage has been my go to flea treatment for years  always works  this last batch i ordered came in different packaging from all the other times i ordered it and it  did not  work  fleas were back within a week  i reapplied after two weeks and the fleas were back again in short order  i have indoor cats  i do not know if i was sent defective or expired product but the batch i was sent this last time was a complete waste of money  i will probably go pay twice as much at my local vet to make sure i am not sold defective product again  terrible experience  if i could give a half star i would 
quality	i am giving this product three stars not really because there is anything wrong with it except my dog just does not like it  it is very hard and really heavy   i have a 70lb  boxer and this toy is seems even a little heavy for her  she will carry it around   if i give it to her and if i start playing with it first  but she never voluntarily goes and grabs it from her toy box like she does other toys 
quality	stinky  our dog loves them  but  i make him keep them outside when he eats them  also  i keep the spares in the garage  p u
quality	same fake bacon smell as as all other dog treats out there  my three would not eat them 
product	this is not a review of the product so much as the quantity i received and the way it was presented by this seller  the product itself is great and my dogs love it the picture presented here by fat happy pets clearly shows a container that appears to be doctored or maybe it was a photo from an older package  either way it looks like a stewart label  which is what i normally buy  but does not have the stewart name on it  when the product arrived it was a 1 5oz container not a 2oz as shown  even worse the add photo mentions 8 oz which is what i thought i was getting  my fault for not reading carefully   you have to wonder if this was not done deliberately to mislead buyers why would i pay 7 64 a piece for 2 of these when i could get a single 11 5oz container for for 18 95 also on amazon and also a prime member  anyway let the buyer beware  i know i will be more cautious next time 
product	i have not seen a reduction in tarter on my grey s teeth after eating them daily for six months  but they are less expensive than greenies  the vet has recommended a powder that is added to her food once a day 
quality	my lil old lady  she s 19  would not eat it  but my friends cats loved it <br  >so now we are trying the pate that i just ordered yesterday
product	my ~25lb dog  who loves to chew but is not aggressive about it  went through this treat too quickly  within a couple of minutes   although the product looks like it is made of hide it actually has the consistency of a stale cookie  slightly disappointed 
health	got them for my seven year old cocker  he got sick after each one  gave him both the small size and the medium  sad to say he ended up with a upset tummy each time 
quality	not impressed with this  our vet uses it  but the dog does not like it    for good reason    it is tasteless we will stick with science diet
health	oh   i really wanted to love this  after reading all the reviews i had hoped this would be the miracle cure for my dog s chronic ear infections but  while it looked as if it may work  at the end of the two weeks of treatment her ear was still a hot mess <br  ><br  >i m giving it 3 stars because clearly it has worked wonders for other pups out there   i think my pup s infection was just way more than even this could handle  nothing has ever worked   but  at the price  give it a shot   it cannot hurt and the hydrocortizone in it did relieve the itchiness while we were using it 
quality	i was having trouble getting my renal failure cat to eat the prescription food  upon doing some research i came to find this food  it was low in protein and high in fat which is what i was looking for  i ordered a case from a different company and she accepted it and ate it  so i ordered a second case again from a different company again she ate it  only this time not as well as the first case  but she still was not eating well so i decided to order a case from amazon and this case she would not even touch  she would nibble it every so often but that was it  i read somewhere that they changed the formula on the item  so i do not know if that was the reason why she ate the one cans and not the others or if she just ate it at the beginning because it was something new  i really with these companies would offer this kind of foods by the can to try them first  so i say try at your own risk and if your cat will not eat it be prepaid to be stuck with it  i guess you could always donate it  i gave it to a stray i have outside my house 
product	disappointed in this kong toy  we only purchase kong toys as we have labs and need hard to destroy toys  this lasted for a few minutes before an entire section was torn off  m
quality	i have tried to give this to my dog several times only to throw out the food will not touch it  gave it to my daughter to try same thing there  back to the old way a dollop of soft food on the top works every time 
quality	nasty stuff  at the risk of sounding like the craziest of cat ladies  i can tell by the smell of the it that this wet food is inferior  some cat food smells palatable  i know  i know   but really  some do not smell half bad   but this gives off a rotten odor  my cat will not go near it  i thought maybe i got an old and or bad batch  but the second go around went no better  now my cat is hungry and will not speak to me 
product	supposed to go in the ball  but my dogs  chesapeake and a lab   get it out as soon as i get it in there    then they proceed to eat this in like 2 5 seconds flat  not worth the money 
product	this was listed as 5 12 2 75 oz cups  which to me  is 5 12 cup packages  i only recieved 1  not worth the price for 1  can get it cheaper locally at warehouse store 
quality	our turtle will not eat the food and it clouds up the water in the cage   i am not sure if it is for larger turtles but we have to toss the entire container
quality	dog will not eat this  maybe formula changed  the food smells like sweet potatoes without a trace of fish smell  he likes fish but too much sweet potatoes  will donate cans to rescue 
quality	the cat got one sniff and we could see how grainy it was  and would not go near the plate  wasted my money 
quality	only giving this product a one star  only because my dog does not like it  he is a 7 lb maltese  and it is really too big for him and it is a small  think he is scared of it  otherwise i am sure it is a great product
health	my puppies love other zuke s treats but they were not a fan of this  the reason i am giving this product one star is because every time i gave my puppies one of these bones the would get diarrhea  at first i though the diarrhea might have been caused by something else so i give each puppy one bone one week later and both puppies got diarrhea again  maybe this will be ok for bigger dogs or maybe i should only give each puppy half of one bone  not sure  either way i am hasitant to give my puppies another zuke s bone 
product	royal canin changed their product so that chicken by product is now the first ingredient  luckily  i found one of the older packages with chicken meal as the first ingredient in a local pet store to wean my puppy off this brand 
quality	it works okay  but the food is hard to get into the ball  if you want the dog to have to work hard  i suppose this is a good toy  but if you do not want them to have to work too hard  i suggest the jw pet company treat puzzler dog toy instead 
quality	bought for my cats  but they would not eat it  my dog liked them though 
product	this review is a reflection of how my dog like these chews  she ate them  she has some hound in her  so she will eat almost anything   but she did not come back for more  which is not really like her  they did not have a strong smell  which is a good thing in my book  they were too pricey compared to other jerky that i could get her  i paid because i prefer to feed my dog the duck rather than chicken  but i just do not feel i got the value for the dollar  this review is pretty much just a   34 blah  34   not good enough for a 4  but not bad either 
product	6 cans were dented  i do not buy cans that are dented in a store  and was not happy so many had dents 
product	  arrived amidst plenty of packing material  but was still almost entirely powder crumbs when i pulled out the unopened package  too expensive  for a product that does not hold together well enough to be an actual treat 
product	this makes my dog puke every time   had to throw out the entire giant bag  waste of money 
quality	as the other reviewer noted  this has large amount of broth  it is more like a soup  and out of the meat chunks they do include  the cans i received were mostly liver   lung    34 where s the beef   34    definitely find it locally and purchase 1 or 2 cans first to see if you cats will like it  cats are known to be finicky  so be careful  i have a feeling this food will be a 50 50 hit and miss or even worse <br  ><br  >pros <br  >1  no carrageenan guar gum  any gum <br  >2  grain free<br  >3  beef flavor<br  ><br  >cons <br  >1  large amount of broth  like a soup   seemingly very little meat<br  >2  mostly liver lung instead of beef meat <br  >3  cost is high for the little amount of meat you do get<br  >4   personal   smell   my cats hate it <br  ><br  >my cat prefers beef over any other meat type  so i have been waiting years for tiki cat to come out with a beef flavor  i was excited to see the gourmet carnivore line  with chunks of beef and liver  although i would ve preferred it if were like the original line  just shredded beef in broth  i decided to try it anyway  and my cat gives it 4 paws down with a disgusting   34 are you trying to poison me   34  look on his face every time i try to serve it  the outside stray cat  who normally loves any wet food  is not picky   also gives it 4 paws down and a confused   34 uh    what is this   34  look <br  ><br  >i think the scent turns them off as it definitely turns me off too  i do not really blame them for not wanting to eat it  it is not like the regular tiki cat chicken or salmon flavors where it just smells like chicken salmon  it does not even have a   34 classic  34    34 cat foody  34  scent that drives felines mad  a la fancy feast   instead  it has an odd  icky aroma  initially  i thought perhaps that smell appealed to cats  but it does not seem to appeal to mine <br  ><br  >note  the two cats have started to refuse to eat the tiki cat chicken flavors also  but will still eat the salmon  hanalei luau   so i am notsure if tiki cat has changed is changing or if the cats are just getting pickier <br  ><br  >your cats may love it  mine were disgusted by it  i would suggest that you try it and see 
health	buyers  beware of the richness of liver treats  sadly these were wayyyy too rich for my dog s stomach  and he had massive diarrhea the entire day  he did love it and it worked really well as getting his attention during training  etc  disappointed as this container will now go to waste 
quality	update as of 11 13 15<br  >i ve decided to go back to the prescription stuff you get at petsmart  for whatever reason  6 months ago he started being picky about this kind  quite a bit would get wasted in the process  due to that it is not much cheaper then the hill s prescription diet  he loves that stuff specifically the tuna flavors  i would give hi tor a chance to see if your cat does like it  unless their super picky eaters  salmon oil does help him eat this stuff though there is still waste  so i can use up the rest of the cans <br  ><br  >as far as ingredients  hi tor and hill s have both been on the same lists for having less then quality ingredients  it is ultimately your decision  with consulting your vet  mine had never heard of this brand  and suggested hill s  not sure if this was partial to them selling the hill s in his office or not <br  ><br  >raja was diagnosed two years ago at the age of 7  he is a wonderful manx cat with a very special personality  he was born next to my bed therefore have a special bond with him  he is extremely picky and eats a little at a time several times a day  these are much cheaper then at the pet stores and do not require me to mess with his prescription card all the time  does not care for thr renal dry food very much but loves this stuff 
health	my two year old pitbull mix ate the entire treat in 1 day   i was shocked  she had a stomachache all night  i guess dogs are not suppose to consume the whole thing so quickly 
product	i have never had a problem with bayer advantage ii until this latest purchase  not sure if i was sent bogus knock off stuff and that is why it is not working  i used to be able to use this product and it would work perfectly for at least 30 days  this one lasts 2 weeks if that <br  >maybe a bad batch or maybe i was not sent the real thing  i purchased 2 of the 6 month supply  the packaging is different than the 4 month supply  did not think much it initially because it was a different product  6 month vs 4   however now that it is not working as well as it has in the past i am thinking i may not have been sold the official product from bayer 
health	just felt like   34 foam rubber  34  and when i tasted it  no taste at all  lucy brought it up after eating  worried not safe 
health	thought these would be great and even reordered one time  however soon after i gave these to my cocker spaniel she got several chunks stuck in her colon and had to be hospitalized for two days and given enemas and suffered a very irritated colon to the point of passing blood  i threw them away and do not recommend them to anyone 
quality	the treat did not git in bone  fog was not interested
product	a complete disaster    one can was completely smashed open  juice running all over the other cans  i had to wash the cans and remove the labels to eliminate the smell as much as possible  in doing so i discovered that the majority of the cans were dented  if i could have marked no stars  that is what i would have done  my cats are old  i cannot risk giving them food that could be spoiled  i order canned cat food online all the time  this has never happened before 
product	turns out these are made in china… my dog had seizures after eating these  do not buy 
health	pro  can use catbox in small bathroom near shower without fear if scattered litter all over  nothing sticking to clean wet feet   great plus  pee pad totally locks in smell  excellent odor control  <br  >con  if kitty has diarrhea  think  earnest saying   34 eewww   34  system really intended for nice solid poo  bag of litter pellets says will last a month  ha  more like a week to 10 days for 2 kittens   esp  with said loose stools   btw  in case you care  vet gave antibiotic  kitties doing well now  <br  >pee pads fill up quickly  forget the package saying one pad a week unless you like cruelty to animals and withhold water from your cat  pellets feel funny on kitty s paws  one kitten transitioned immediately  the other one avoids the pellets and has discovered the clump able litter in downstairs box and chooses this box over the other one when she has the option  you could mix pellets in with current litter in old box until your cat gets used to it  then switch systems <br  >summary  superior odor and scatter control  expect to use more pads and pellets than advertised 
quality	stinky    <br  ><br  >i ve ordered these multiple times and have always been satisfied   until now  this shipment arrived with different labeling than previous orders and they are not odor free  in fact  they downright stink  it is all i can do not to gag when my pup is chewing on these bully sticks  i can only guess with the change in labeling and the horrible odor that these are not the same sticks i have happily received in the past  super disappointed     
health	just realized that their product is made in china  not all products made in china are tainted  but enough have been that it is not worth the chance of harming or killing your dog by buying them when there are quality products made in the usa  canada  or europe  shame on me for having bought this in the past and not noticing the country of origin 
quality	i thought my elderly cat would like the salmon  as she had gone off all her other kibbles  no  she did not stay with it  after the second day  she refused to eat it  i think there must be an after taste which she does not like <br  >i ordered the lamb and rice   be careful which selection box you click on   and she does not really care for that either but does not reject it <br  >i will probably stop wasting my money on premium kibbles and will go back to off the shelf stuff  while increasing her canned portions 
quality	dead bug bodies and life bugs on the bottom of the bag  my dogs were really excited when the package arrived this morning  the pieces are big and looks very nice  i put the big pieces into a glass container and poured the crumbs into dog bowls and was ready to give it to my dogs  then i found something moving  when i looked closer  there were bugs and black bodies of bugs  it is going right back to amazon  amazon used to allow refund for food items without sending the food back  but i am totally ok to send this bag of low quality food back  terrible  i will upload the pictures as well  update  10 2 2014  apparently amazon  or whoever was in charge of the products  decided to take all my pictures showing the dead bugs off the custom pictures  buy at your own risk  i would suggest you buy it from a store so you can make sure you see the inside the bag since it is clear packaged  i did receive my refund after sending the package back 
quality	this is a horrible product  and the seller did not tell the truth about the jerky  my dog tiko will not touch them and the reason is      it looks like pressed paper  not jerky  tiko loves jerky  and this is crap for lack of a better word  two thumbs down for this so called jerky 
product	i am not really sure if this helped my dog or not  we were also instituting diet changes and using noromectin to treat her mites  the bottle of shampoo is pretty small  so if you have a large dog  my girl is 60 lbs and has a lot of long hair   you might need more than one bottle  which is sold separately  smelled a lot better than some of the other mange shampoos i have uses  still seemed to irritate her skin though 
product	warning  this is not 11 2oz like the description states  this is only 3oz  way too much money for 3oz 
health	one of my two cats liked it but then did not about half way through the bag  both of my cats love purebites  i believe this is a quality product  but if my cats will not eat it… the chunks are huge and have to be broken into much smaller pieces  they can be a bit hard to break up  it is important to watch your pet with both these and purebites because they can choke on them  my kitty did    even though i thought i had the pieces small enough  i would not go bigger than ½  34  square and then stick around until they finish the treat  i also but a bowl of water next to the treat 
quality	my dogs have been eating this brand of dog food since they were pups  but there was something wrong with the last bag i purchased from a local pet store  everytime my dogs would eat  they would throw it back up  i had the 26lb bag for two weeks and there was hardly any gone because they would not eat it and when they did eat it came back up  the store did take it back for a refund  i wrote the company with the product numbers and so on  but i have heard nothing back  that was over a week ago  i will not buy this brand again  i will find them something else with grain free limited ingredients where the companies cares to contact me back with concern about my dogs  let me just say  that the bag i purchased via amazon had nothing wrong with it  it was the bag i purchased from the local pet store that had the problem 
quality	i saw the reviews saying cats did not like the taste  but my cat is 10 years old and has never been picky in his life so i did not worry  well there is a first time for everything and now i have an entire bag of cat food my cat refuses to eat  not sure if its the size of the pieces  they are bigger than the ones in my dog s food   the smell  bland  dog food like smell  or the taste  i did try mixing it in gradually with his old food  but it just made him not even want to touch his old food  he will just look at the bowl and then meow at me  very disappointed with this purchase 
health	these bones made my dog sick  she threw up every day she had ate one  i would not recommend giving these to your dog   they should be recalled  
quality	it is very sturdy but the size is huge and i found the item very bulky  if you chose to purchase this item  pay close attention to the dimensions   it is much bigger than other treat pouches i have used and i do not like it at all  it is almost like having a purse attached to my person 
health	if you love your cat and want him or her to eat better and most important live longer  i recommend you try grain free cat food not a specific brand just a type of cat food   my kitten is 12 weeks old and will not stop farting after he eat royal canin  i first thought it might be the size of the food so i brought baby cat which is smaller  i use kitten royal canin before   and there is blood on his butt after he poop  turns out it is the food itself that make him sick  he is now perfectly health after we took him to the vet and change the food 
product	i was very disappointed with the size of this product in relation to its cost  sun seed is a very good brand  but i spent nearly  2 per strand of millet and that is unreasonable  usually the pet food and pet items i purchase online are much cheaper than those on the neighborhood stores  but this was not the case this time 
product	i got this so i was shipped a package each month  each package was completely different  first package was very moist and cat loved them  second package was very dry and crumbled  i could not even cut them in half  they were not the same fish shape as the first pack either  third pack was dry as well  same shape as first pack  fourth pack was a little better  moist  than the last two  after this i decided with the inconsistency he was better off without these  i use cosequin instead 
quality	my little dog will not touch them  my 20 lbs eats the  smalls  in 5 seconds  they are too hard and i think they swallow in pieces  definitely will not buy again 
product	my 9 lb yorkie destroyed this toy in 2 days  it is made of a soft  pliable rubber     and   34 tears  34  apart very easily  i put treats in each hole the day i received it and gave it to her  two days later i found it under a chair and the material had been bitten all the way thru on the outside of each   34 hole  34   one hole even had a chunk taken out of it  it was useless to use for treats after that  and i was afraid to just let her chew on it since pieces were so easy to tear off  so i threw it away     <br  >i m surprised that this has the name   34 kong  34  on it  and i think now that it is either a knock off  or it is just a misuse of the brand name  if your dog is as tenacious as mine and will stop at nothing to get to a treat  do not waste your money 
quality	the price is right on these  but my yorkshire terrier will not eat them  she is had milo s and skinny mini s you see  and after those  these just will not cut it with her  they only work if she is starving  and she just looks at you like   34 alright  i guess i will help you get rid of them  34   chewing slowly while looking around for a more desirable crumb that someone might have dropped 
health	updated 5 months in and 5 of my 13 cannot or will not eat this  4 refuse 1 still burps up sludge   the remaining dogs only get 1 2 cup daily mixed with their other diet so i can feed out what i bought  i contacted wysong and they said their trials of this formula change had not anticipated this result  maybe they will change back   but we are done unfortunately   now happily feeding dr tim s grain free and wellness core mixed w raw<br  ><br  >i m trying to ease epigen chicken into my kennel of 13 huskies  they have been on grain free for years  i have several dogs who are drinking tons of water and burping   vomiting up murky brown sludge 5 8 hours after eating  i bought several hundred pounds so i am really hoping this formula  which many say is the newest and is giving dogs problems  is just a little too rich and really hoping in time they come around     not happy but will do my best to follow the feeding suggestions on wysong s website where they say it may take a month  i will update if things turn around for the better  i give 2 stars for the wysong reputation but zero for epigen at this time
product	i was excited to purchase the good dog treats after reading the positive reviews  my basenji did not like the biscuits  i got her to eat one of them but them  reluctantly  what a waste of money 
health	will not give my dogs these treats  did not realize they were made in china upon purchasing  one of my dogs got sick on the first one  so the remainder will be trashed  only gave one star so i could post review 
product	i have used this product for my dog before with good results  the price on amazon was the lowest i found so i ordered it  unfortunately i had to return the product because it did not work at all  i was refunded promptly 
product	not durable for chewers  expensive and advertised to be more durable than it truly is which makes me so upset  i love the shape and size and idea    i wish there was a material that could be used with this that my girls could not chew up and spit out  i even tried picking it up after they got their treats out but after the 2nd use  the hole appeared  if you do not have a dog that will chew through everything  this is a great toy 
product	these treats are crappy quality  read the ingredients before you buy it  some of the everlasting treats are made in china to make it even worse 
quality	i read the reviews prior to purchasing these  and they were pretty good so i assumed my dog would just eat them  like a treat   i really assumed it would something similar to the heart guard dog treat  they are a pill  and larger then i was expecting  my dog will eat just about anything  but he will not eat these at all ever  i have even crushed them and put them in wet food for him  and still refuses to eat it  they are sitting on the counter and will probably not be used  they are too big to shove down my dogs throat  he s small 25ish lbs poodle mix   and with his other pills it is just not worth the fight  i wish i would not have bought these  and rather would have went to a pet store and looked around until i found something more of the treat variety 
quality	the bag arrived open on the top  the rip was about 4 inches and i left a packaging feedback  i had no idea we do not have a return option even with prime  i am alarmed that the the food content might be contaminated and would prefer a replacement from amazon or proplan  but i am not sure if it will get here soon enough  will have to go to a local retailer cause our puppy has sensitive skin and can not eat any other formula 
quality	they are great as far as my dog in concerned but the smell is overpowering  i had to throw them out  dried out too much and really smelled up the kitchen when i opened the bag 
product	this indestructible toy for large dogs was destroyed within 20 minutes big pieces came off so i would not buy it anymore nor recommend it
quality	my dog does not like it  must force it on her  but after  she does seem to eat 
quality	my dog liked them until they dried out  for a puppy break them into quarters  1 pc   4 pc  just enough to give them a taste and they work great  however  even sealed they only last a couple of weeks  once they dried out they seem to have lost flavor and the pup was not as thrilled with them  opened a fresh bag and the enthusiasm for the treat returned 
health	re  shipping condition of the item <br  ><br  >bag arrived bulging  thinking it was just air pressure differences  we fed some to our cat and it gave her diarrhea  had to throw it away    <br  ><br  >re  cat eating the pill <br  ><br  >our cat ate the pill using the pocket  but as noted above  because the pills were apparently spoiled  it made our cat sick  we only used three of the pill pockets and had to throw the whole bag away 
quality	treat is too hard  my puppy spits it right out and cannot even chew it 
product	disappointed that it was shipped internationally  seems to be same product just two pkgs instead of one six pack
product	am sure some cats will like this  i have two cats and neither of them show any interest in it at all so for me it was a total waste of money  product is well made somewhere between baseball and softball size 
quality	i must have the pickiest cat   he will not go near this 
health	weird  these are weird and cause diarrhea in my dog <br  >she likes eating them but then has digestion problem in the house <br  >not worth it
product	i switched to advantage when frontline stopped working for us  it has only been 2 years  we been fighting fleas all summer  typically  one treatment gets rid of them immediately  i cannot imagine both dogs simultaneously being immune to its effects  i think we had a bad batch  i wish i had the lot number  seems like a lot issues this season  i am going to switch to advantix to get rid of for now  i think we are going to switch to the pill next season 
health	danger  the inside is rawhide   bad for your doggie s innards  better to buy plain jerkey made in the usa 
quality	cats would not eat it  tried to wait them out  but felt bad after a day and got them new food
product	very disappointed  these are incredibly thin and not worth the money 
health	do not know how they went so wrong here  the can is a 90  beef liver and 10  chicken ratio  the liver is tough  hard and chewy like rubber  too easy to choke on and does not chop well with a knife  this formula is awful and needs serious re formulation  do not buy this flavor but do not let this one formula turn you away from the highest quality cat food out there  name another brand that is human grade 
health	our cat seemed to like the taste of this food okay  but immediately after we switched to it she started barfing it up  just the food  not normal hairball barfs  several times a day  we gave it a few weeks in case she just needed to get used to the new food  but the barfing remained just as frequent <br  ><br  >we bought a bag of fromm surf and turf formula cat food to try instead  our cat absolutely loves it and has not barfed once in the weeks since we switched her to it  it is a little more expensive  but clearly higher quality 
quality	it is not me  it is my cats who do not like it  they eat wellness dry and canned because of the high quality  wanted to also offer a good quality treat  but they prefer the   34 junk  34  ones 
product	this is the second of this type that i have used  i have had this one for just over 2 mos   and once again  one of the inner hinges is breaking  working with my puppy this morning  i pulled out a piece of metal and almost gave it to her as a treat  nice  these are junk  and they do not last  either get a different kind of bag or pouch  or buy a trainer vest to put treats toys in  they work much better  very  very disappointed with this product 
quality	my cats hate it  will not eat it  please cancel all future orders 
health	beware    does not safeguard dogs from flees in the southeast   i have had multiple reports confirm this
product	my chickens liked some of the ingredients  but it had quite a bit of filler ingredients  things that just did not seem like much  i will not purchase again because it was quickly eaten  or dropped on the ground to go to waste  and it was pricey considering the amount i got  not a good buy for me and my chickens 
quality	huge chunks of dried apples and carrots  my african grey does not like dried fruit or veggies  also  why pay prices like this for bunches of peanuts in the shell 
health	treats are very well made  but my dog  75lbs  would not completley chew them the whole way and sometimes gag on the treats  they are very high quality but the form shape of the treats are too dangerous  lots of other dogs have had the same issues according to amazon reviews  i should have listened  now i have two huge bags i am going to throw away   
health	cat liked  did not throw up which does on a lot of food  i found at local store cheaper 
health	some of my cats will eat with it on others will not  one of my cats diarrhea got worse 
health	purchased two of these on august 13th of this year  and neither dog found any kind of relief  i convinced my wife to let me try this instead of going with a collar or topical flea tick treatment laden with chemicals  but after giving this nearly a month  my dog is still scratching as much as ever  one dog sadly had to be put down not related to collar  just old   this is even after daily flea combing  where we find lots of fleas and eggs  along with doing everything we can to make sure fleas are not still hanging out in our home  i purchased these well aware to give 3 weeks or longer  but come on  shall i wait 6 months until it gets cold again to notice no fleas  i know i would not want to be miserably itching for that long  from an attractive standpoint  they look neat  and i like the effort of a company to offer a non toxic alternative  which is why i gave it two stars  however  if my dog ends up miserable and open to a parasitic infection or something else from non stop fleas  then looks alone will not get it done  both of these will be going back for a refund 
health	utterly disappointed  our one dog would not touch them  the other dog had a total of two and she was sick for 3 days  we will never buy these again and would never encourage any of our dog loving friends to try them 
quality	seems like a good deal  but my cat does not like it 
health	this brand made my dog sick and not able to eat for 4 days  do not recommend  i threw them in the garage <br  >there should not even be a star by the product <br  >jacquie
product	my dogs had fleas within 2 weeks  going back to the more expensive stuff
health	this brand made my dog sick and not able to eat for 4 days  do not recommend  i threw them in the garage <br  >there should not even be a star by the product <br  >jacquie
product	the product is fine  or at least it has been in the past  delivery was poor  my dog wont eat them  as they were melted and smashed together  throwing away  i would really like a refund 
health	do not give these to your dog repeat do not <br  >my dog got sick after about 2 hours and started throwing up violently <br  >they have to know there are side effects <br  >my dog did nothing wrong  i thought these would be helpful for their teeth <br  >my dog did not deserve this <br  >the c e o  should rot in hell for doing this to my dog 
product	made in china  i did not appreciate that production information was not clearly made available  product did arrive quickly and in good condition 
quality	my kitty does not like these as much as another smaller size name brand  i tried this brand in the pate style  still not my guys favorite  he usually gobbles everything down  he eats both dry and wet cat food  i probably will try a different brand next time  i got caught going for a cheaper price 
health	i have been buying this brand for a few years  my dogs have allergies and this food helped the itching to stop  imagine my surprise when i went to reorder this  just like i have for the last 2 years  and the price is almost doubled what it is been  i think that paying  50 for a bag of food is still pricey  but i was happy to do it knowing that my dog was getting good food  but i will not spent almost  90 for it   that s very extreme when comparable food is being sold for much  much less  i will find another specialty brand 
quality	our dog does not like most treats  he loves these  the treats are like cookies that are not too hard or too soft 
health	my cats like this food  but two of the cans in the case were dented and open and one was infested with maggots  absolutely disgusting 
quality	my caiques will not eat this treat  i was hopeful  but no dice  sorry  they do love harrison s pellets 
product	it is full of everything i did not want to feed to my cat   carbohydrates and by products  not sure how i missed it but the cat is not getting this lot  it is annoying marketing hype that presents this as a good food source for young cats  i will be returning this bag and not buying royal canin again  i preferred wet food anyway and this teaches me why 
product	i have been ordering this product for years  this is the first time that i have had one application vile empty  i even cut it open with a scissor it was empty  the same thing happened with the second bayer advantage i purchased for small cat 5 9 lbs<br  >this is an expensive product   to have to lose one from each box does not make me happy with bayer health care<br  >hope i can be compensated 
health	i bought this food for my two dogs   my one dog loved it but the other dog developed a food allergy from it  according to the vet   i would suggest talking with ur vet before this food
health	good but extremely moist and boy do they stink  i have one dog that loves them and one that does not  until something else is created for allergies then this is the best i have found 
health	after many boxes  bella got very sick from greenies  they are off her diet now    i had bought multiple boxes  now i am stuck with them
quality	quality and value are very good  however  the salmon strips really stink like  well  stinky fish <br  >and although my dog loved them  her intestines did not  she exploded in the middle of the night  it was ugly  my bad   too much  too soon <br  >because of the odor and my dog s explosion  we tossed out the remainder of the bag <br  >this is unfortunate because it is so difficult to find made in usa dog treats that are sensibly priced 
quality	i was very disappointed that all the treat bags expired this september  i do not want to give my cat expired treats so all but one bag are unusable  i wish i knew the expiration date before i ordered 
quality	9 1 14<br  >i purchased 3 more bags of the omnivore mix a couple weeks previously  i buy several bags per month <br  ><br  >unfortunately  this is the first time that all three bags i purchased were entirely devoid of anything but   34 veggies  34  and crickets   no silk work larvae or meal worms what so ever <br  ><br  >my bearded dragon loves the silk worms and meal worms  which is the reason i buy omnivore mix in the first place  so i am disappointed with the company s poor quality control this time around 
product	received timely  however bag inside the box was torn from one corner  i did not return but kept the product as it was a minor issue  possibly got damaged during transportation 
product	i have three dachshunds  none of them were the least bit interested in these  i will not buy any more 
quality	my cat will not eat them even though i use the dry food and they love that  probably because these are moist they do not like the 
product	impossible for dog to get treat out  all it would do is frustrate her  i could not remove it with fingers  she would have eaten the rubber 
product	way overpriced for what it is and do not let the picture fool you <br  >the package is so beaten up you have mostly crumbs and no bites 
quality	do not choose this specific flavor  would not go near the toy with these flavored disks 
quality	my birds will not eat this  i have over 18 species of birds visiting my feeders  i put this in logs with holes drilled through  it is always the last one to be eaten when everything else is gone  i still have about 3 4 of the case i ordered <br  ><br  >the woodpecker treat suet plugs are eaten first and by all kinds of birds  not just woodpeckers  i am on my 5th case of it since they all eat it first and all i will put out for them 
quality	the dog loves them   we do not like the smell of the salmon on the dogs breath 
product	although they are made with quality ingredients  in no way should these be considered  dental  treats  the large size is completely consumed by my 50 pound dogs in less than two minutes  they simply bite off large chunks of the bone  there is no gnawing  the action they can claim physically removes build up from teeth  they just eat it  way over priced for a treat 
health	my dog got sick on these and regurgitated them  it came out hard  like it was plastic  i washed her blanket and after the wash  at the bottom of the wash tub  were the same pieces  unchanged  as they came out of my dog  i am not sure how dogs digest these  my dog does not have problems with her stomach  she has been eating regular milkbones for years without problems  also  changing treats or dog food before has never had these results 
health	these have garlic powder in the recipe  garlic is no no for dogs  did not see the garlic in the ingredients list till after my dog began throwing up 
health	unfortunately  it made my 5 year old shitzu sick to her tummy   
quality	i have five dogs   none of them would go for this with medication and to make it worse  they would not eat them just as a treat either  a couple of my dogs are also what we call garbage hounds and they will eat anything but not this stuff  it is not the peanut butter either  my dogs love peanut butter <br  ><br  >one additional note  these pockets are huge  tried to break them down for the smaller dogs but they would not eat them either  you could literally fit four or more pills in one pocket  not a good idea for smaller dogs – even if they would eat the product 
product	wow  this was destroyed in record time  honestly  it went from the package to the trash can in less than 30 seconds    i have been sooo happy with the quality of other kong products  this however  is best suited for a dog with no teeth whatsoever  my dog literally grabbed it from my hand as i was taking it out of the package and tore 3 petals off before it hit the ground 
product	this is the second 6 pack i have ordered in august 2014  the bags were puffed out very tightly  as if they had sat in the sun and the heat made them expand  the product is not pliable like the greenies i am used to  this product crumbles and the pills cannot be contained inside  i am returning this second 6 pack  on a better note  i ordered 3 single bags which obviously come from a different lot and they are perfect  i will be ordering singles in quantities of 3  4 or 5 so i do not have to keep returning the product  i do not know if the truck sat in the heat sun with the pallet on it or if this was a bad batch from the factory <br  > from back of bag  best by 25feb15 29 1  409c1kanp1 09 02 
product	i received expired product and got a prompt refund from the seller  but that is not the reason for my one star review  the product itself was a disappointment  as i had already given this to one of our dogs before seeing the expiration date  and by the time i took it away  a very short time later  as i was just opening up the other package for my other drooling pup while the other dog had hers going  i realized that it is just a super thin coating over rawhide  my mistake for not taking a closer read of the description    34 chicken wrapped pressed rawhide   but it is disappointing that these were just an overpriced rawhide treat  which i prefer not to give to our dogs very frequently  and they are not very excited about plain rawhide anyway  with a very short lasting coating 
quality	this thing stinks to high heaven never used had to toss it
quality	very disappointed  there is something different with the salmon  my cats used to eat it right up but now they will not touch it  i called friskies to see if it was bad or if they just changed the recipe and never got an exact answer but they did send me coupons to get replacement 
quality	i have been feeding yummy chummies to my yorkie for years  this is the first time i bought it in such a large bag and will not again  normally these yummies are soft and i can break them into tiny pieces for her  but what came in this bag was extremely hard  way too hard to even break in half  i am having to soak them in order to break them  so i find i do not use them  i would suggest not buying these in this large bag  oh  and i checked  they are not out of date either  they are just hard    maybe someone else has had a different experience  but mine is not good  however  i would say that in the past the small bags of this product was excellent and a great treat for my dog 
health	was much smaller than i realized  my 10 week old lab puppy can fit the whole thing in his mouth  i am afraid he might swallow it and choke 
product	never had an issue with pet food being shipped until this arrived  package opened and freeze dried chicken all over the box    just wasted part of my morning returning this 
product	real flimsy  zipper gets caught and you have to be very careful or you will break it 
product	bought these when costco was sold out of the similar chews  our dogs liked these well enough  however the greenies are small and pricey for how much is in the package  the nyla bone type chew treats sold by costco are far more economical 
quality	horrible smell   it has been weeks and i could not get rid of the horrible plastic and chemical smell  i threw it away <br  ><br  >don t buy  
quality	there was nothing wrong with the package and it came quickly enough but the hay was old and very dry  when i buy it locally you can tell there is more moisture in the hay  my guinea pigs would not eat this  i do not know if it always comes this way or maybe i just got a bad bag  at this price though  i would be willing to try it once more in hopes that it would be fresher 
health	i have a cat with chronic diarrhea so i tried this brand  it did not help but both my cats ate it and did not seem to have a problem with the taste  recently my vet told me that cats do not need the kibble at all and that i should just feed them both wet food  since they are true carnivores they need real meat and very little carbs  kibble has a lot of carbs  if your cat has a sensitive stomach i would not feed them kibble at all but suggest giving them a hypoallergenic low carb canned food  also try uncommon proteins like rabbit and venison 
quality	my puppies do not like them     unless they are really starving   
quality	seems like a great product but my dog does not like it very much  i got a good deal from amazon though  much cheaper than petsmart 
quality	my dog would not eat it  i even tried feeding her before her meal thinking that she would eat it since she is hungry  i guess the treats are worst then her dog food  very disappointed 
quality	listened to the reviews again   55 lost  bought it for the glocosamine  but my dog will not eat this or the canidae brand  she loves the cheap store food at  15 a bag  guess i just have to supplement the glocosamine  
quality	my dog would not eat them  he did not like the flavoring
health	gave one of these to my dog and she ate it no problem  the second one i gave her a week later got stuck to the roof of her mouth causing her to choke and convulse  it was like a glue paste when i was finally able to remove it from her mouth  cannot imagine how that does it their stomachs    threw the rest away and will not be giving her any more 
health	made my dog sick  gave him terrible diahrrea after he ate it  the vet put him on other foods and the problem stopped immediately 
health	this food is ok   one of my cats has food sensitivity so even though she likes it she cannot eat it as it triggers her allergies  the other cats like it  i stopped ordering it when the price went up by 2 dollars for the 24 pack  for that price i just buy a higher quality food 
health	found out these were the cause of my dog vomiting  she kept vomiting for a couple days so we decided to eliminate anything new we had given her in stages  after we eliminated this she stopped vomiting  they have a very strong mint smell so perhaps they are upsetting to sensitive stomachs 
quality	i cannot believe the rip off     description says 8lbs  shipping weight and 8 7oz treats  the package arrives and i get one treat  what     they must be crazy   8 for one treat  no way  sending back tomorrow  what a joke     i now know never to buy treats from amazon  the descriptions are not even close to being accurate  i work way too hard for my money to throw it away on some rip off company  do not waste your money on this place 
product	i really like these treats for our dogs  in the past we have purchased from costco but they do not sell them anymore so i decided to purchase online  something happened to the package somewhere in the distribution process that went very wrong  by the time the bag of treats was delivered to my home  the little bear biscuits were in broken down pieces  i do not think there is a whole one among them  the dogs like them so i decided to keep them in the current state rather than return them 
quality	my cats used to love this food  but for the last couple of times i have gotten this food from the amazon subscribe and save  all 8 of my cats have refused to eat it  i paid 18 00 for the last case and i had to throw all the cans away  i even gave some to my daughter s cat  and she also refused to eat it  i do not know whether they have changed the formula or what  but i am not going to buy this food again 
quality	i am sure it is a great product  but my dog would not eat it 
product	would give 5 stars if they were not so expensive  the rubber delivery toy is ridiculously expensive  also  i wish they were made in usa 
product	this toy took my rat terrier all of thirty seconds to figure out  he simply bites down on the yellow treat covers and lifts vertically  voila  treat exposed  thirty seconds of animal engagement is not worth the purchase price 
product	my dog likes them but they really are not worth the price 
health	just be aware that these are not the same as the grain free buddy biscuits that look the same and has almost the same packaging  these contain wheat  so if your pup has a wheat allergy look elsewhere for the grain free version of the same treat <br  >good for small dogs who love peanut butter 
product	the packaging could be better a lot of the food gets broken down and turns to powder
health	my 10week old mini schnauzer puppy is chewing on most everything  and i needed an alternative    to occupy her   <br  >she devoured these hard treats in less than 10min  and then made her sick soon after <br  ><br  >these last her all day  and keep her out of mischief    <br  > nylabone enhanced rawhide roll puppy treats  copy paste  as they do not show up on a normal search  <br  >i got the 25count econo pack  tried the 6pack 1st   and keep them in a zip lock bag so they do not dry out <br  ><br  >i will also try the nylabone teething ring  as these may be to hard for now  i ll ask my vet at next appt    
product	this is super dumb  do not buy it  all the food fell out with just one try  i really like the iq treat ball  sebastian will roll it around for 20 minutes to get 1 scoop of food out
product	long lasting  my bulldog just chewed one of these down in under five minutes while i was taking out the garbage  i have seen petsmart rawhide bones last longer than these did  waste of money 
quality	the boy loves bully sticks  he loves them so much that he is walked into walls following me when i have walked across the room whilst carrying one  i bought these since it seemed like a relatively economical way to get him his bully stick fix <br  ><br  >for the first few days he was in bliss  when i had a little half of the bag left  i noticed a they were getting much skinnier in size  then one day     he was all happy when i gave him one  he then retreated to his special spot where he devours it  i noticed he suddenly jumped up  at first i thought that maybe there was an insect on it that stung him  he still seemed interested in it  but then kept jumping up  as if he was being shocked  i noticed this was happening only when he was touching the ends  i picked up the stick and noticed the ends had some strange red substance <br  ><br  >i got another one  he was excited  then same thing  jumped up as if he was being shocked  tried another one  same thing  and another  the same thing  even more disturbing was he took one of them to his bed  after i removed it  whatever it was on it must have gotten on his bed  because he started jumping up as if we was being electrocuted <br  ><br  >needless to say i threw away the rest of them  i have no idea want it was  but clearly there as some strange substance that seems to have either tasted terrible or irritated him <br  ><br  >won t be getting these again <br  ><br  >very disappointing 
quality	i am not sure if this really works  my dog does not eat as much as he used to but i think he may just be growing out of the puppy habit as my vet told me  he still does it occasionally  this product did not completely deter my dog from this disgusting habit  if he is hungry he will still partake 
quality	my cat liked it for the first few doses of her daily medicine  after that she refused to eat the greenies  my cat could not talk to tell me why she would not eat them  
product	these are made in china which i did not realize because i clicked on made in the usa
quality	my dog really does not like these but she will eat them on occasion
health	although my dogs like this  i found out this was made in china and inspected in u s a  i am truly disappointed  makes me nervous and concerned if this could harm my dogs  as soon as i found out i threw them away and will not buy it again 
product	not pleased with advantage ii anymore  does not seem to work  doubtful that i will continue to purchase it  it is very expensive for not doing the job 
quality	nutrident has changed their formula  after 7 years of eating one of these each day  my dog will not touch them now  the smell from the freshly opened package was very strong and smelled like chemical  i will not ever buy these again 
quality	my cat ate this maybe twice and now will not touch it  he eats really well so it is not needed  my sis uses the dog kind of this product and she eats it daily like it is a treat 
product	too small for a new puppy  i was disappointed i could not offer it to the golden puppy  did not want her teeth to get stuck while she played <br  >the next size up was just right
quality	my dogs seem to enjoy it but stopped eating it after the first 5 cans  i do not understand why  will have to try another dog food 
product	i did not realize the first ingredient is wheat flour  my dogs like them  but i am trying to get them away from wheat  probably will not order again 
product	this bone was not really what i thought it was going to be  my dogs puppy and adult were able to get the treat out in seconds  then they started chewing hunks of the blue rubber off  so i ha to throw them away after 10 minutes of play time 
product	i was pretty disappointed when i received this bucket because i was expecting to find a lot of pumpkin seeds  but sadly it is mostly filled with cracked corn and some other feed that my chicken had no interest in  they actually just went after the few oats and pumpkin seeds and left the other stuff behind <br  ><br  >i found it to be a total waste of money and will probably just buy some pumpkins and toast the seeds myself  that is a more inexpensive route and my chickens will love it more 
quality	i do not think sophie like the word   34 senior  34  because she could care less if i serve her this food again 
product	each order i have rec d from you has had at least 2 cans badly dented but were usable  this is not unexpected  as such things occur in shipping of heavy items  the most recent order  for 2 cases of canned special dietary meals  arrived exactly on the date stated but with many cans badly dented  several more mildly dented and one which was crushed so badly the sauce gravy had spilled and soaked the box  of course  the contents were spoiled and i had to wash all of the remaining cans  several more were dented more on the bottom or sides  only one other was dented on the top edge so badly i had great difficulty getting it opened without cutting myself on the sharp edge of the lid  i discarded it as i did not trust it for feeding to my cat  two cans out of 48 is not a big loss  but perhaps the cases could be surrounded by a stronger set of   34 pillows  34  than are now in use  thank you for allowing me to   34 state my case  34  
quality	my geckos would not touch this  i ended up using it as an expensive roach chow add in  they loved it 
product	my dog had a hard time getting these treats out of the kong so it was kind of a waste of money for us  but if you have a smart dog maybe it will keep them entertained 
quality	max likes them  but he is never turned his nose up at anything i give him  the sizes of these vary   they do not look appealing   i am not fond of<br  >touching them 
quality	my geckos will not touch this stuff  i starved my gecko for a year because it says on the website   34 do not feed them anything else but this and eventually they will eat it  34   still ribs and all he would not touch it  i got another gecko and did not want to subject her to that  i just decided to sprinkle it on the crickets so they were not completely missing out
health	my 2 dogs ate these at 6pm and vomited at 2am 
health	ok  so my cat loves this food but it is really hard on his tummy and ended up giving him diarrhea  he does not have issues with his digestion with other wet foods so i know that this little guy was the culprit  since i ordered two cases  i have a lot on hand so i still give it to him intermittently  about one cat twice per week or less  and that seems to be okay on his tummy  this is just not an every day  every meal food for my guy  for these reasons  i only gave a 2 stars rating  for how much he loves it  i would give it at least 4 stars  i usually like larger cans so that is why i would not go for 5  
product	my dogs love them as a treat  just not really doing much for fleas
quality	they were not fresh very hard had to throw them out
product	do not use in vaporizer<br  >it globs up and turns into what is basically glue  and it is incredibly different to remove  i read a review of this somewhere and somebody said that you could use it in one  guess the internet fooled me this time <br  ><br  >using this under her nose did not really work for my rat s uri  but maybe it is providing some relief  giving 3 5 stars because i just did not notice any benefit in my particular case 
health	cleared up my dog s slight ear infection without a visit to the vet  hurrah 
quality	i am not convinced these are the same treats i have been giving my dogs for the last five years  the packaging is different and the texture is spongy and not crisp  also  when i opened the bag the odor was very strong  beauregard  my great dane turned his nose up his favorite treat 
product	this product is made in china and gnat was not made clear  i have bought this product before where it was made in the usa or germany 
quality	my cats will not touch these  i have even mixed it up in their food  and they pick them out and will not eat them  i have given them dried fish flakes and they like fish in general but they will not touch these 
product	disappointed    <br  >i agree with the other comments about too many sunflower seeds  also  sugar and sulfur dioxide on the ingredient list found on the package  i feel like this was a bait and switch  these things should be listed on the item description page  i paid too much money for my babies to feed them this sort of crap  i have done a lot of research and read so many positive reviews about this brand  i will not be buying this again  i will save my money to spend on what is best for them   fresh fruits and veggies 
health	will make your dog very sick    i gave these to my dog and it made him very very sick  i thought it was just my dog but my neighbors dog tried them and his two dogs got very sick also  bad product  
product	my dogs hate them  maybe because they are good for them  but a waste of money 
health	this left my little maltese very greasy all down his back  which was kind of gross  and i am sure he was ingesting some of it   it kept the fleas off for about 2 weeks  maybe 3  and then they started their infestation again  i will not buy this again 
product	does not work  found fleas and dog scratching away like crazy  does not kill any fleas at all  do not buy 
quality	my pup does not care too much for it  maybe too hard rubber or dislikes the taste of rubber  she loves to lick peanut butter out of it  it will last forever because she does not chew it  only chews on my house haha
health	my fish eat everything with protein  flakes etc  this was not selling with them or bottom feeders   stay with frozen shrimp  blood worms and ballance flake diet
quality	sorry  barley bones  my dog would not touch them  would not even try one 
quality	i have received 2 bags so far  both have been poor quality  the prices are crushed and there is a lot of food wasted because it is smashed into tiny crumb like pieces 
product	i do not know about the rest of the country  but fleas in southern california have adapted to survive frontline over the past few years  i keep thinking i just got a bad batch  but nope    wasting my money 
health	this product gave my cat pastey diarrhea  he had it so bad that he was defecating in the house where we would step on it  carpets  clothes  tile  etc  i know that it could not be his diet because him and the rest of the cats eat the same home cooked grain free merrick brand of<br  >cat food  that cleared up his food allergy that i realized he had after it had cleared up from the food  the product does prevent flea infestation  but i think that i will be moving on to revolution next time  i never had a problem with that product 
product	this stuff just does not work  i have used what i thought was the same product in the aerosol spray version  it worked very well  killing fleas  the pump spray bottle  however  does nothing    also  the bottle had been leaking a bit inside the package   everything in it was drenched with  allegedly  poisonous insecticide 
product	my dog loves these but they are expensive and extremely crumbling in package  you get about 9 whole and the rest are in pieces and mashed  wish they packaged in better containers 
product	i am disappointed that purina dropped the highly rated chicken and rice for a new line that is too high in protein for my older cat who has thrived on chicken and rice for 5 years  now i cannot get it for her and she suffers as i help her to a new product <br  >cw in ny
product	has the sizing changed recently  i have a subscript<br  >ion to these treats because they keep my dog entertained  but for the past two months i have not been able to get the treats into the groovy ball  so frustrating 
product	that looks like my dog on the package  anyway  he enjoys them as a   34 treat  34  after my attempts at brushing  do not know if they help with breath nor plaque 
health	i am not saying that it is completely the treats fault because my dog had enjoyed them for months  although they never lasted for more than a few minutes  but my dog is currently in a vet hospital because she needed to be anesthetized and scoped because she choked on this treat and it got stuck in her esophagus  if your dog tends to slam down treats and not really chew them then this is not a great treat because it can be broken down in to large chunks which can then get stuck  i have a few left and i will probably just get rid of them as i do not want another dog owner to go through this  i will stick to big bones or tiny treats from now on 
product	not worth the price when i can go around the block for a dollar cheaper
quality	my cats would not eat this  there was more liquid than meat 
product	we love wellness in our house  the kitties eat wellness wet and dry food  but they did not really care for this one  one of my foster cats  who eats everything  ate these  but she is very food centric and not picky at all 
health	when i was looking at this i could not find the ingredients list  this product does contain isopropyl alcohol  if you are looking for an alcohol free product  this is not the product for you  it does seem to work and did not seem to irritate my dogs ears too much  however i would have preferred an alcohol free product  it is a purple color and will stain items if you get it on them  the ingredients are isopropyl alcohol  boric acid  gentian violet  colloidal silver  i have previously used epi otic which is alcohol free  smells really nice and worked great for us with a prior ear infection 
quality	this is good food i only gave it a 3 star because i have a 3 year old brussels griffon he has a short nose and very small teeth  he would not eat this food at all i thought he did not like it  but he could not chew it up it is so hard  i cut them up and he gobbles them up he loves it but this is an incredible hassle to do  so if you have short nose dog this may not work for you 
product	item did not work for any of my dogs  very disappointed 
quality	my cats usually love treats of all kinds  but they would not touch these  disappointing 
quality	animals will not touch it  it may be bleached or something  it looks unnaturally light and uniform like white meat from albacore but the animals will not eat it 
product	be aware  i received expired item from amazon which is very disappointing  it came with all my subscription item together and i did not realize until i opened it  the color was yellowish which is different from what my dog is eating  so i went to the trash can and picked up the box  it says exp  21apr 2014  but i received it in june 2014 
product	this did not even begin to kill a single flea in my house    total waste of money  and of course no refunds or returns    do not buy this  it is a waste
product	came missing the top lid and no retail packaging and my dog usually eats out the top of it  after four five months  he still has not quite gotten the hang of getting the food to fall all the way into the dish  so about once every day i will kick the tray to get the food to fall down into it 
product	very expensive   2 bone  my dog enjoyed  but i will look for something more reasonable in price  sorry that they discontinued the joint and hip bones at  1 per bone 
product	just found out made in china  i no longer give it to my pets 
product	my cat did not like it  although it was not expensive  i am a little annoyed that i spent money on a box with holes in it 
quality	cats will not eat it  even when sprinkled on wet cat food  too large for a pill shooter 
product	2 cans where crushed and dripping food  the rest was ok 
quality	my dog loves other chicken jerky  but would not eat these  she is finicky though 
quality	my dogs could not care less about this toy it sits in a corner and is never played with despite how many times i v tried to get them interested 
quality	i will not buy again  my dog does not like them and i also found out it is made in china 
quality	only three stars  but that is because my senior cat was not interested  adding catnip to her kibble and treats kept her busy for about 10 minutes  perhaps it would be suitable for a younger cat  worth a try  as it is an attractive and sturdy toy 
quality	my cats would not touch their food  at all  when i used this product  it may be great for some but not for mine  that said  some cats are finicky  i gave it a two star rating not because i believe it is a bad product   just a bad product for my animal kids 
quality	too large for my dogs and too hard for their teeth 
product	ordered this item twice and both times i received a different item  disappointed 
product	dogs love it but the price on amazon is way too expensive  i can get two boxes at target for the same price 
health	first dog treat causing our dog to get upset stomach   throw up
quality	good but most fruit prices are stale and my macaw will not eat them
product	used on my dog and it did absolutely nothing  not a thing        the fleas never went away  total waste of money  going to try frontline instead 
health	like others say in their reviews my dogs started vomiting often when switched slowly to this food   i had to switch them back to their other brand 
quality	ordered two large bags and this is what i received from milos kitchen will not order those small bags again and to top it off my dog will not eat those treats and they were his favorites   just not happy with the quality of product i get all the time before 
product	pkg arrived promptly but packaged poorly  half the cans were dented  several were cracked open 
health	i thought i would try this to flavor up a dull dry dog food  but it did not seem to spark any fanfare from my dogs  the older female barfed all of it up within two hours and the other  well he is just spoiled and not interested  it is quite pricey for such a small package and no directions on how to use which may have accounted for the barfing  as i may have added too much to a small amount of water  or maybe it was something else  i do not know  i just will not be buying this product again  as far as i know the livers from the chicken could be diseased and since it is dust  who knows what else has been dried and ground up and passed of as dog food 
health	the cadet duck jerky is a productof china  made my dog very sick  i gave some to my daughters 2 dogs made the youngest very  very  i will we thought we were going to lose him  1600 00 dollars later his life was saved  but with kidney damage made the other dog sick  but not as bad as the pup  why does the untied states still buy this from china knowing their products kill our animals    
health	my vet recommended this for my shih tzu who was staining to go alot  the product instructs that you give 1 packet a day  regardless of dog size   i think my little 12lb juliet should have 1 2 a pack  i quit giving it to her because her stool became too soft  but it did stop or straining constipation 
health	i gave my dog one of these the day the bottle arrived  and the following day she was very ill with a mysterious gastric disease that put her in the hospital  there may have been no connection  but this supplement and another one i bought at the same time were the only two substances my dog ate different from her normal food  i dumped them both 
product	my dog loves these  but the packages both arrived crushed  hardly any in the pack were not broken 
product	it is not that i hated them but our cat did    we got the exact product from our vet  probably an older package  but our cat loved them   they were drier and not so gummy and greasy feeling    he can tell the difference in them immediately    i guess he is just too fussy but we love him          
health	i do not know if he is just allergic to something in this stuff or what but my dog got terribly sick off this stuff  he broke out in hives  had a fever and had mucus coming out of his eyes  i researched and he is getting the same benefits from plain no sugar added yogurt 
quality	dog eats it sometimes <br  >does ignores it sometimes <br  ><br  >i guess she does not like these anymore since i started giving her other treats 
quality	my dogs do not care for the taste  i try my best to hide it in the food  they are the cheaper brand  so you get what you pay for i suppose 
product	you have to be really careful with this and maybe on large dogs it might be o k   but it made the tummies red and irritated on my little doggies  i would not buy this again 
health	these made my dog sick for some reason  she eats other milk bone brand treats fine but these did not do good things to her 
quality	do not know what the deal is  but my chickens will not eat these 
quality	perhaps my expectations were too high  since both of my cats have arthritis and one has resulting mobility issues  my 18 year old cat ate one morsel  and has refused to eat any since  my younger cat sniffed the morsels  and walked away and will not even try to eat them  what a disappointment  especially since a good friend had told me how satisfied she was with this product  i purchased the chicken formula because chicken anything is the favorite flavor for both cats  i am hoping others have much better experiences than i have had with this product 
product	i am so unhappy with this purchase because it did not help my animals at all  i have two dogs one weights 110lbs and the other one weighs 17lbs and i also have four cats  so that is three packages i bought and it was expensive  i wish i could get my money back  because i am not going to use the rest of the applications  because i am going to get another brand  i want a refund 
quality	ripped right away  i contacted their service center for a return  they stated they needed to look into it and call me back  i never received a call back  very poor quality 
quality	natural balance sweet potato and venison dog treats  8 oz bag    small breed   my two chihuahuas like this small size but the regular size which really is not that large  they will not touch  maybe this was a bad batch and the ingredients were not as concentrated or tasty  i actually bought this larger size by mistake thinking it was the smaller biscuit  it came as a daily promotion from amazon in my email and since the price looked right  i clicked and bought it  if you have small dogs  stick with the small breed biscuits as they appear to be more flavorful 
product	we used this food for quite a while  but the weight problem never really resolved  at this time  we have been informed that most pet food is made in china  and have switched to blue buffalo  which is made and processed in the united states  we feel this is a safer option 
health	i generally love the milk bones i buy in the store  and my dogs do as well  however  right after purchasing these online and feeding them to my dogs developed diarrhea  that was negative for parasites at the vet   i stopped all treats for a few days  and the diarrhea resolved  however  after i gave them the milk bones again  the diarrhea started up again  i am concerned that the batch  product i got was tainted or bad 
product	be careful with this  i have long haired cats  and it made them very greasy       will not buy it again  although i will buy hills science diet  regular  again 
quality	i ordered this for a 6 month old yorkie who just is not very interested in it <br  >i  m guessing that it would work for larger breeds but in my case even though<br  >i ordered the 3 inch ball it just did not work at all 
quality	the top will not stay on  it is cheaply made and poor quality 
quality	we tried these as a replacement for starmarks chicken treats  our gsds stomach did not care for it too much  so back to chicken it is <br  ><br  >when paired with starmarks toys  these treats can help keep your dog occupied for quite some time  be warned that if they get chunks of the treat out  it can get stuck in carpet 
product	it ended up being easy for my pup to figure out where the treats where  did not really hold his attention 
product	i bought these for my granddog  her mommy only gives her certain things  she loves them  but i will not buy them again  because of the high price 
product	not really like the exact item from the local pet store  this particular sheltie did not like it 
quality	i have purchased other wet noses treats in the past and have been 100  happy with those products  however    this specific flavor choice is not a good one  immediately upon opening the bags inside the box i noticed a very   34 chemical  34  smell  it stood out to me as odd since the other wet noses treats never smelled this way  i have several dogs that refuse to eat these  i recommend sticking with the other wet noses flavor choices over this one 
quality	these are not crunchy like others i have purchased  they are not soft as in chewy but inbetween and though the dogs love it they seemed to really go nuts over crunchy ones  that said  the price was right and i cannot complain about it based on that 
quality	i was not real excited about this product as my babies will not eat the oats at all 
product	this is not about the actual product  which is excellent  this is about amazon and their ineptitude  they used to offer this product as a prime option  no longer  as the price stands now  it is less expensive from a retail outlet  great job  amazon  every other natural balance product is available with prime  keep it up  this will work out great  can anyone say    34 compact disc   34  that will be amazon s fate if they keep this up 
quality	none of my indoor kitties  especially the one i thought might benefit from it would eat it  i tried putting it out for my outside colony and they would not eat it either  even the raccoon and possums were loath to eat it <br  ><br  >i m sure that somewhere there are cats that will like it  but not in my household 
product	not worth the money  worked great last year  not at all this year  do not know if it was outdated  or an immunity was built up  but is not working at all 
health	ok so originally i bought this product for my cat to drink out of etc  basically the traditional use of it <br  ><br  >my cat did not like the taste of the water in the plastic bowl in comparison to his current ceramic soup bowl he drinks out of unfortunately  found this out when i caught him drinking out of the bath tub which he never does <br  ><br  >long story short i use it now to place his old bowl inside of it and have it stabilize it so he will not be able to splash and spill whenever he drinks  it worked like a charm and i am fine with this setup and i still recommend it even if the plastic taste was very unappealing to my cat it still had it is use 
quality	want to start by saying this product is as advertised  and there is nothing wrong with the unit itself  bought the 6lbs feeder and the 1 5 gallon waterer together so i could keep my 2 cats fed   watered during some business travel  quality is reasonable  sturdy  durable  but the lid on feeder does not fit very well  <br  >what i do not like about this is that my cats think they are play things  they got mesmerized with the water   food falling when eating   drinking and started to  dig paw  at the trays causing one well of a mess  dry food everywhere is just a hassle but easy to clean  water everywhere is not fun when you have hardwood floors that tend to warp very easy if left wet  i have no confidence in leaving my cats with these things full of food   water which totally defeats the object of having them <br  >summary   product itself is fine  but design of these types of feeders does not work for me   my cats 
health	my cat vomited all evening after eating this food for the first time  i returned it    
product	my hens seems so so about oyster shells  they much prefer crushed clean egg shells and grit from the yard <br  >contrary to rumors i have heard  feeding them crushed egg shells does not turn them into egg eater destroyers

health	my dog loves these but the last bag i purchased made her sick  she threw up several times after eating the treats on different days  i know the new advertisement states us tested and irradiated but   34 irradiated  34  only makes me nervous <br  >taking a chance of losing my dog to   34 tainted  34  treats is no treat to me  she is the love of our families life 
product	i ordered these in march for my 2 small dogs and had to throw over half out because they got bugs in them even with the foil lined inside package sealed  they had eggs and bugs all over them 
product	i thought this was a deal as these pill pockets were larger so i thought it would be easier to hide the pill in  my dog will eat them but will hesitate at first  the pill pockets are not very moldable  they can crack apart when you insert the pill and squeeze the top   maybe it is because i refrigerate the pills but i also let them come to room temperature before using  the package does not say to refrigerate the pills but i just feel that they will remain fresher that way  especially living in hawaii  i began to coat the pill pockets in peanut butter to help seal any cracks and to entice my dog to more quickly consume the   34 treat   34  later i found that using only the peanut butter to coat the pills works equally well  if not better <br  ><br  >i will continue to use these pills until they are used up but do not plan on buying any more  i am sure other people will have different experiences depending on their dog and the type of pill 
product	i find it hard to separate the water bottle from the bottom part and i am not a weak person  i like the volume it holds so i only have to be frustrated about every 2 weeks when i wash and refill it 
product	package says up to 15 lbs  amazon com says up to 25 lb puppy  false advertising  this matters to those of us with 20 lb puppies still growing  wanted to get my pup the next size up  which this product description reads  for puppies up to 25 lbs  on amazon  the box says otherwise  great treat  disappointed with the mislabeling 
quality	my dog did not like these at all which was disappointing because of the other good reviews  these had an unusually bad smell to me and i ended up throwing them away 
health	since it is the first time i try this product  so i just add a small portion to his regular meal  but my dog had bad diarrhea reaction to this food 
product	this product did not work as advertised  treats did not really come out  my dog  who does not normally chew up his other hol ee rollers  just chewed through the soft rubber to get to the treat in the hard plastic inside ball  i would stick to other treat balls 
health	i liked that they were organic as this is all we feed our dogs  we only buy made in the usa or we make it ourselves  i decided to give this a try when i saw such good reviews  it arrived promptly and had good packaging  it is on the expensive but all organic is  i have two dogs  i gave them each one treat and within three minutes they both vomited  they are small so they cannot afford volume loss  i has to throw the bag out  the dogs are not related and are different breeds 
product	great toy for a soft chewer  however  our dogs demolished the toy 
product	bad value  this dog toy is durable and works ok  but way overpriced  this toy would get 4 or 5 stars if it cost between  10  15  gotpetsupplies was a fine vendor  delivering on time as expected  the value proposition for the product is poor 
product	these arrived with an expiration date that was 8 months prior  i was so disappointed because i was going to give them to a friend for her dog s birthday  they are very cute but hard as a rock  it is hard to rate something that was never used but i will give them 2 stars for being cute 
quality	if not  then you may want to reconsider  it has a very fishy small  my dog would not eat this even though he usually eats  everything  he can get his snout on  if your dog likes fish then this will probably be a good fit 
health	my cat seems to prefer the   34 hairball  34  tuna treats more  i think i ordered mistakenly<br  >the wrong kind  he loves all the hairball varieties   
product	i was trying to find my zelda a variety of food that had less filler ingredients plus something besides chicken  beef or fish variety  she approached the first can eagerly but did not finish more than half of a small pile  i wound up tossing an enormous amount  colossal waste of money 
product	my dog loves these treats but they were delivered crushed  they looked like someone had stepped on them  out of the three boxes i ordered  only one was in any way usable and even that one was at 50   do not order these until they fix the packaging protection 
quality	the dogs will not eat this product would like to know why   your idea is great for natural products organic would be a better product
health	these treats are a favorite with my dogs  as anything that is real meat makes them very happy  i used to buy them at costco  and gave them to our 2 dogs for a long time with no problems  so in october of  13 when the fda was warning everyone about jerky treats  i did not worry because we never had a problem  costco stopped selling them in january  14  and i had been searching for something good  in april  14 we had a new addition  a third dog  and 3 weeks after she came to our home  i found these same duck treats on amazon  i ordered 2 bags  while i waited for them to ship  the fda came out with new warnings about jerky treats  and i worried a bit  so when they arrived  i watched my dogs for a couple of hours after eating them <br  ><br  >i received them on may 13  and the 3 dogs ate them  and we had no problems       until memorial day  we had been feeding them to the 3 dogs for 2 weeks  and while the other 2 dogs seemed fine  the new dog suddenly became lethargic  and had diarrhea  within 2 hours after eating the treat that day  i rushed her to the er  and she was severely dehydrated <br  ><br  >the jury is always out about this  because you cannot say for sure what made it happen  did she eat something else that made her sick  is there something in the treats that her delicate system cannot handle  is the fact that these are made in china a problem  costco stopped selling these  but still sell the same brand of chicken jerky  and it is made in germany  germans are sticklers for the rules  and love consistency  so i would certainly trust them in this matter  there is nothing wrong with china  it is greedy businessmen that bend the rules to get ahead and make more than they made last year  so the product would be better to buy  in my opinion  if it were made somewhere that not only i could feel better about  but also could have some sort of recourse if something went wrong 
quality	this came stale  it may have been packaged wrong as other people told me it was a good product  they look cute but not<br  >my family did not care for the taste 
product	i bought these for my small dogs and they seemed to like them  then i bought them again and they were hard and crumbly  naturally my dogs did not like them  i did not return or ask for a refund  i just figured i got a bad batch  bought them one more time with the same bad results  i will not buy them again 
product	the bag was ripped  was not very happy with how it was packed  the product is a good product  better packaging is needed 
product	3 months in and mosquitoes all over his face constantly  and yes they are biting not just hovering  not buying this again 
product	made in china now  cannot recommend and my vet said do not feed anything made in china  so  i am sorry  the dogs used to get these  but no more 
quality	i do not eat them but the ad did not say they were made in   34 china  34   and i do not feed mr  brown food made in china  unfortunately i did not see the title in tiny print   34 made in china  34   he loved them but i do not trust food made in china 
health	the product used to work  however  i believe the fleas have caught on  two weeks later my dogs are infested again  i am in florida  and advantix ii s simply not working  my rottie get terrible flea allergies  i am now using trifexis  it is more expensive  but my dog is so much more happier  do not recommend this product 
quality	half of our order had bags that were obviously broken at one time  and taped with packing tape  it may have held a full 5 lbs  but i rely on my items arriving without question to their safety for the animals in our habitat  the attraction factor was huge   the squirrels  blue jays  black birds and even crows would not eat them  unless there was no other food available in the habitat  only then would one or two nuts be taken  this is very rare  when the nut ring is filled in the early morning  it seldom has any nuts left by mid day  these peanuts remained in the ring for so long  i dumped them  after a couple of rains  and tried again fresh  still the attraction issue remained  i will never purchase this item through amazon com or this vendor again  i will remain with drsfosterandsmith   i cannot keep enough of their nuts in stock
health	happy with product in past few years but this purchase was a waste  pet was infested with fleas  even after applying required amount twice in one month <br  >i will look to purchase from another seller or change brand completely
product	i have been giving loving pets carrot treats to my dog over the years and he has loved them  the packages that i received this time had slices which were white in color  they are usually orange  and had a very stale   34 off  34  smell  there is no   34 discard by  34  label on the package  but i expect these are simply too old  i am going to look up return policies 
product	works fairly well at first but once my cat figured out the trick she became quite bored  also it either took her 2 minutes to extract all the treats because the hole was pretty big or she gave up in frustration because the treats became trapped and could not get them out 
quality	my cats do not like this nearly as much as some of the other tiki cat tunas  i am stuck with it 
quality	this is like an antler off a baby deer    my golden will not even look at it either  maybe it is him  but this antler has little appeal to a dog 
quality	i was hesitant about buying these based on some other reviews i had read  and my fears were confirmed when i took the brand new treat out of the bag and offered it to my little pup  he sniffed it a few times  looked at it strangely  and refused to eat it  thinking he might just need some time to sniff them out first  i put a few in his food bowl  he promptly tipped the bowl over to remove the treats and left them lying on the floor  these were a major disappointment 
product	i have a lab mix and something that looks like a fox mix and neither of them wanted these  very disappointed 
health	i have given my dog these before and he enjoyed them  but a few hours after i gave him one of these he vomited  i thought he would eaten something he should not have and waited a week  gave him another one and the same thing happened  will not buy bil jac again 
product	one of my cats got severe jitters with this and it did not get all the fleas  i was disappointed  not sure if i will use the remainder of product on my cats 
product	absurdly expensive    9 97 per 7 1 oz  that is  22 50 per lb   friends <br  ><br  >my dog will eat these   an already pricey  5 99  but for the equivalent<br  >of angus filet  he will be treated otherwise at substantially less cost <br  ><br  >these should be renamed <br  ><br  >hills pet consumer fleecing treats   for those with more money than sense 
product	it is made in china and vets do not recommen feeding ur dogs anything from china so i switched to hdp duck jerky strips b c it is made in usa
product	pic is not for item shipped absolutely no sunflower  safflower blend only  my birds hate this  waste of   poor advertising very disappointed  too bad  could of had a good customer i have several big birds 
product	i purchased 7 of these about a year ago  i love them  my cats love them  they are sturdy  they go thru the dishwasher well and stack nicely  but  i thought they were expensive then at  11 each and now they are over  20 each  ridiculous  i am buying the durapet stainless shallow dishes instead now at a fraction of the cost  they are about the same diameter and have nonskid on the bottom and also stack and go thru the dishwasher 
health	my dogs love these bones but these nylabones tear up their bowels  if you feed your dogs these great tasting chews please check their stool soon after for blood  a trip to the vet may be warranted  as in our case 
quality	my yorkie does not like this food  although he is very picky with what he eats  i make a lot of his food  so when i try to give him soft food with his vitamins and minerals in it then he does not want it  if he gets really hungry then he will eat soft food 
product	i do not know how much i am supposed to tell based on one bag of this  but i did not notice a weight difference in my cat  she seemed hungrier which made her angrier  i have since found a less expensive brand available at retail stores that i now use 
health	our labradoodle seemed to have no issues with the first bag we ordered last year  became very sick with vomiting and diarrhea after most recent purchase  treats are made in china 
quality	ordered this to replace the wysong epigen 2lb bags i had been feeding my min pin  this bag came in and he would not touch the food <br  ><br  >when i mixed his old food with the new food  he would pick out and eat the old pellets and leave the new pellets which would still be waiting until the next feeding   \<br  ><br  >ended up switching to taste of the wild brand after getting a sample from a local pet store  the dog loves that stuff  but he is more gassy and his breath noticeably poorer  but more consistent defecations  so still hunting for the perfect kibble 
product	horrible  many of the cans on the sides of the box had busted and the box was leaking wet cat food  i had to throw over half the cans away because they were busted  creating smell and leakage in my mail room then my apt when i brought them up  i want a refund  i thought it would be easy to buy in bulk from you  and that you would put the appropriate padding around the product  but instead it got banged around so much that the cans were busted  big mess in my kitchen too  disappointed  do not use this vendor 
health	from the greenies package <br  >  34 attention as with any animal product monitor your dog to be sure the treat is adequately chewed  gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to your dog   34 <br  ><br  >watch out  making ground beef and rice for the dog that gulped hers  hope that clears her stomach and intestines 
health	i only buy nylabone for my dog since she has stomach issues  i noticed she does not like it as well as the other treats that look very similar to this one  the others i cut into little pieces and put inside her kong to give her a little challenge  these ones crumble  i will not buy again
health	my cat did not like it  he can be choosy  he threw it up and won  touch it  he continues with hairballs 
health	my cat has way too many eating issues  including a grain allergy  i like the quality of this food and wanted to try the different   34 flavors  34  so the variety pack was great  we ended up choosing the   34 wild salmon  34  as her favorite 
quality	it was great at the first  because cats liked it  and it was extremely cheap so helped my tight budget <br  ><br  >i did not even look at the ingredients till my son pointed out <br  >i bought two 13 5 pounds bags  so i wanted to finish it <br  >but i stopped feeding my cats after i saw the significant hair  fur  issue 
quality	the product is good but my dogs do not like it at all  i think it has no smell and too tough for them 
product	another reviewer posted this too  and i agree  the drawstring is loose inside the lining of the bag  which means that often it falls down inside the lining  as a result you very rarely get to use the entire volume of the pouch  which is frustrating  i bought this and am looking for a replacement that does not have this flaw  i recommend you look for another item if that is important to you  if not  then the item is durable and fits well on a belt  although cannot clip to the leash  
quality	i already know fresh tripe smells bad because i feed it to my dog  this tripe treat stinks worse than tripe  or any other treat i have ever had  just touching it leaves the horrid smell on my hands that is hard to remove <br  > i also has synthetic preservatives in it  i bought it thinking it would be dried tripe  something natural  i am disappointed at the additives  i will not be buying this again

product	the shipper was very fast  the product was destroyed by my 2 year old lab within 12 minutes  i expected a tougher product for the price  disappointed

health	it is unusual for a natural dog treat food to use canola oil  i have ordered other natural balance treats for my dog that suffers from allergies related to wheat  corn  and soy and i have never had a problem  i gave her these and she broke out immediately  i will admit that it was mostly my fault for not double checking the ingredients  but generally  if you are getting   34 natural  34  treats and food  things like oil made from common allergens should not even be an issue  oh well  read labels 
product	i have three dogs and none of them liked this  i also sprayed some onto my finger and smelled it  it did not really smell of real bacon and cheese  then i tasted it and it is awful  no wonder why the babies did not like it <br  ><br  >i ruined my dog s kong toy with it  he used to always play with is kong toy  but ever since i filled it with that cheese  he doesn t  then it dries fast and it sticks to the insides  it was not easy to clean on my end <br  ><br  >maybe get another flavor or something   just not this 
product	as people have different tastes i am sure dogs do too  this brand is not so well liked by mine so think of donating my 2nd delivery to the local   34 dog pound  34   fast delivery and though i cancelled my 2nd delivery i got it anyway which made me angry  now 2 50lb bags to donate 
product	in fact  he was kind of scared of it even though we left it for him to try to explore it for several days  i thought the curiosity will kick in but that did not happen  so now it just sits in the storage  very disappointing 
quality	one needs a chisel to actually get the product out of the can  it is so dry and hard     just like cement  dogs do not like it at all and i will not purchased this again  very disappointed 
product	we have ordered elk antlers twice from this seller  and the first time  we got an antler similar to the photo  it was a sturdy  medium sized antler  we were so happy with it  and our dog loved it so much  we came back to get another one  what was shipped to us was about 3 4  34  in diameter   so more like a small stick than an antler  quite a disappointment  if you order and get a good one  you will be very happy with the product      if 
product	my cat threw it up <br  >my dogs still have fleas  not worth the money <br  >it does not work on cats or dogs 
quality	i have three dogs and not one would eat these  good price but not worth it if the dogs will not eat it  i thought they would love these because they are liver  not so  and my guys are not picky eaters  my advice  save your money 
product	i got the small alfie  it comes with no instructions  so i broke up some treat bits and stuffed them inside  my 18 pound cockapoo had torn the rubber to pieces within 10 minutes  with small rubber bits all over the floor mixed in with the treats  so it was pretty useless 
quality	generations of my cats have enjoyed this cat crack  i have not seen it around in stores recently  having been replaced by the  crunchy bits   which are just dry cat food in an expensive bag  when i found these soft pounce on amazon  i ordered  these things are not the same  they are a synthetic looking and smelling nugget of chemistry that the cats do not care for  i have never had cats turn up their noses at pounce    until now  very disappointed  but hey  now i have 5 bottles of them 
health	i gave this product only one star to get cat owners  maybe even dog owners  attention  i have an older cat who got a clean bill of health from the vets but had chronic diarrhea and no appetite  i turned to these enzymes in hopes of helping  it did increase his appetite which i was so thankful for but he developed a skin allergy on his face  if you read the cautions on animal based enzymes this  plus other reactions  can occur  i was giving less then the recommended dosage  i stopped the enzymes and the rash cleared up  waited several weeks and started again on an even lesser dosage than before  more breakouts  unfortunately he is allergic to an animal based enzyme  please  please read all cautions before giving this product  it may be a good product if your pet can tolerate an animal base enzyme  most enzymes are plant based so there has always been this concern <br  ><br  >i just wanted to add that i do not review products but i feel so strongly that people should read all cautions and keep a close eye out for reactions  our pets are counting on us  i am not saying this is a bad product   but just be aware 
product	only one item was shipped  not a pack of 6  i have asked the company to fulfill the ad as written  and will update this spot if they do so  in the meantime  you should probably not buy this  because it cost over  11 with shipping    for one  3 bag of catfood  shame on you guys  wag 
quality	i cannot say there is anything wrong with this bird food  however  my bird does not like it so i put it outside by the bird feeders  those birds ate the black sunflower seeds before they would touch it  that does not hold well for the stuff if even wild birds will turn their noses     mmm beaks up at 
product	product came as promised  but it was not as fresh as the product i can buy at the pet store  also was over packaged 
quality	i bought these as a treat for my little beta because i want him to love me and love his life  but he will not touch them  first  he tried and then spit them out  now he just swims away  darn it 
product	we thought we were buying a larger size but it seems to be working  we wanted it to keep tartar off back teeth of cavalier  so far so good  came quick and the packaging was in great condition  all good with amazon 
health	i have a tiny maltese  and this is the second one of this specific toy that she has bitten off the top of and eaten  i thought maybe the first one was defective  but it is just a poorly made  but expensive chew toy  not safe 
product	dogs like it  but the cost is too much  just too expensive  but someone has to pay for the packaging 
health	at our vets recommendation we fed fortiflora to our cat for several months to see if it would help control<br  >loose stools  it did not  so the vet tried other meds and ordered hills prescription gi formula food which does seem to be helping  the problem in some cats can take awhile to manage  we are told  we are hoping that a dietary change will work otherwise there may be other causes involved  i friend s cat did respond to fortiflora  it just was not the answer for us 
health	my cats would not touch unless starving  even put in ice box to see if would harden up a bit  no way  like giving soup to cats  ok if you got a sick cat  will not order this again
health	i love zuke s treats and the filets are my favorites for training classes because they are large enough to lure  not messy  and break easily into smally pieces  i ordered 2 of the 3 packs because we go through them quickly  when i got the order  i counted the packs and put them up  when i went to use them for class  i found that i had received 5 chicken filets and only 1 venison  since one of my dogs has a poultry allergy  i now have 5 packs that only my small dog can eat  i just find that irritating and poor customer service 
product	picture portrays a rawhide chew stick which is standard  25  34  thick  perfect for my 8lb dog  however i received two rawhide bones that are 1 75  34  thick  the cost was  8 95 and it costs more than  5 to return since it does not allow a refund  therefore  i am out  8 95  will not do business with them again 
quality	a good idea except my dog was not interested in it  no matter what kind of treat i put in it  even pieces of meat 
product	i threw them away after all the negative reports on these treats made in china  do not want to take any chances with my beloved puppy 
health	my order arrived in good condition   packaged well  my lil  cat was acting up w his appetite lil    thought by feeling him this treat might help in changing his diet  he liked it but not as eager to eat   his other brothers did not like this at all  a lil  expensive but thought this might keep him heathly  decided not to order anymore   tku trish  o 
health	my little rat terrier  whose name is tinkerbell  got real sick and stopped eating  she would not even eat this nutri cal  going back a bit  she was about 7 years old when she had her first litter of puppies  she developed what looked like a swollen lymph node on her neck after she had the puppies  i did not take her to the vet  but when i researched the symptoms  it appeared that she had lymphoma carcinoma  i had another dog die because of this same thing  i think it was caused by the food they had been eating for years  it was the regular pedigree dry dog food <br  ><br  >i changed her diet  and forced her to take some mannatech ambrotose powder that i packed in a   34 00  34  gel capsule  every day for 3 weeks  which is a lot for that size dog  after the first 2 days she defecated some of the nastiest stuff that i have ever seen  and then she started to eat again  i stopped giving her the ambrotose after the 3 weeks and only gave her the nutri cal every day  but she got real sick again after 2 weeks  she got to the point where she could hardly walk and she was drooling real bad just like before <br  ><br  > it was the ambrotose that saved her life again  i used to sell ambrotose but i do not anymore  although i still believe it will heal cancer among other things that are cause by a poor diet  i am going to buy the real expensive dog food from this point on  i know this sounds like an advertisement but it isn t  it is exactly what happened ambrotose is very expensive and i do not know if it will ever heal her completely  but it will keep my little tink alive one day at a time for as long as i can keep this up 
health	it had gotten to the point that one of my large dogs would often choke on the last bite of ear that she would swallow because it was too large to go down  but not large enough for her to hold with her feet  i quit feeding the ears after several incidents of me having to pull the last bite of ear out of her throat  she does not get bully sticks or trachea stuck in her throat like she does the ears  so i provide other things for treats now  my other large dog ate the ears without any issue  never give a treat like this to your dog without supervising him her the entire time it is being chewed eaten 
quality	my kitten throws up violently every time he eats this  it must be very tasty to the kitten as he eats it with relish  god knows where the ingredients purina sourced from <br  ><br  >i went back to home made cat food   ground chicken thigh  bone and all   salmon  chicken hearts and liver with vitamin and a little oat bran added <br  ><br  >thank you but no thank you to purina for the offer  after this review was posted  to replace the product  i will not take any chance  if purina is that careful with their suppliers  why the recall in 2007 for melamine contamination 
health	i bought this for my dog on the same day that warnings about dried meat treats from china are killing dogs  i wanted to return it and amazon of course has great customer service  but amazon should have clearly put a warning that this product could be hazardous and link to recent stories to let buyers beware <br  ><br  >i chose not to return this one bag because my dog loves them and this one bag was too much of a hassle to return  but i only give my dog 1 2 pieces at a time and am nervous every time i feed one to him and i will not buy this product or any dog treat from china again <br  ><br  >i do not know what i would do if i knowingly gave my dog a treat that killed him and right now all is ok   this product should be banned from the usa going forward and amazon should either warn us or take it off the site <br  ><br  >cause if i knew it was a chinese product i would never have bought it     and it should not have been this easy to buy something that could kill my pet 
product	i get these whenever they have them at my local grocery  for 89¢  buying here  even tho each are 3¢ more  i said   34 what the heck  34  and got the pack of 50 as my 3 cockers love them  got them today  and am so disappointed that i am compelled to write this  these ears are not half the size of the ones i get at the grocery   so i will not be getting them from here again i am sorry to say 
product	this product was just on all the network news shows  it is made in china and has killed over 1500 dogs in the us in the last year  do not buy this product  i returned it  it is lethal  do not buy any treats or food for pets from china 
quality	our ferret will not eat these so there is not much more i can say than that  we are using them as dog treats instead
quality	my dog will not eat them  fussy dog  yes  but i have not  and won t  tasted them so i cannot tell if he has a point or not  i am sorry i got two of them  i am going to give them to an older gentleman who gives out treats when he goes for a walk  other dogs might eat them but my little guy won t 
product	was spoiled will not order this again  would not recommend this product to any one  the birds i fed it to died within 2 or 3 days <br  >i do not expect a refund 
health	my cat did enjoy the treats for a while but then gave up eating them  he has an infected eye and they did help when he did eat the treats 
product	this rollhide kept my dog busy for about fifteen minutes  however  i was looking for something that was going to keep my high energy siberian husky a little more interested  she devoured it fairly quickly  i will not buy this again  old fashioned rawhides take more time for her to chew it up 
product	this is the second set of doggie treats i have bought from the amazon site and both seemed to toughen up over time  so tough that my 4 dogs have begun turning up their noses at them  smaller bags are so expensive that i try to find them in these large bags  they get up to  8 a pound in grocery stores and for that i can feed them fresh cut steak  but the price  shipping and so on was fine just as i expect from amazon 
product	when it first arrived  both ends of the tower were crumbled possibly due to packaging  and when i put is on my feeder within an hour  with the help of jays ans squirrels  it crumbled to the ground where it will get eaten but not what i wanted 
quality	i used it a few times and the dogs did not care for them  i now use tropiclean and they seem to like this product better
product	waste of money as it is sitting in my drawer  the space in the middle is too big for most treats 
health	my cat s never been difficult about her litter box  she litter box trained herself at a very young age and i would never had any issues with her  we have used the crystal litter as well as normal clay litter  and she used both just fine  then i purchased this thinking the less dust would help her allergies  she has watery eyes that i thought we could help correct  instead she started peeing in a corner of the living room  she would refuse to go  2 all day until she absolutely could not hold it  she never once peed in this litter  i had to mix it with regular clay litter for her to finally give in  the odor control is not great  it does track less   although since i am combining it with clay litter that is kind of irrelevant  i will not be repurchasing since she clearly is not happy with it  i can handle a little extra vacuuming if it keeps me from having to clean the carpet daily 
quality	this product makes my dog feel better  but she does not like the taste of it  i mix it with kefir and squeeze it into her mouth with a syringe 
quality	not sure if they are old  but my bird will not eat these  and he loves yogurt treats  he will hold it take a bite and then drop it on the floor or tosses it to the dog  the dogs eats them  so not a total loss 
product	most of my fish died as soon as i used it  it is poison to fish  i would never buy this again and threw it out 
product	wont buy again  it does not seem to keep flee s flies or ticks off of my dogs  and the bottle leaked and vaporized so i only got one use out of the whole expensive bottle 
quality	i do not like that the ball is so hard  when they cannot bite down on it to get the treats out  they end up just tearing it apart  my dogs made the whole in it much bigger  so now it is useless except for maybe throwing it outside  because it is so hard it was very loud when they played with it on the hardwood floors 
quality	it may be good for other dogs  but my great dane does not like it  he is used to the  large dog  size kibble and the taste may be different also he will leave most of the food in his dish with the  giant breed  formula and will eat all of his  large dog  formula 
health	one of my cats loves these treats and the other hates them  as far as delaying any hairballs  i cannot comment  since my cats have not really ever had hairballs 
product	the product itself is not worth  9 50 and you do not get enough for the price  i would not recommend it 
quality	first bag both cats loved and the texture seemed smoother  more chicken like  second bag one cat eats  the other turns his nose up 
quality	my puppy was not impressed and turned his nose up  however the cats were more than happy to help consume this product so it was not a total loss of money  go figure  lol
product	taking every precaution and following the directions exactly  i was shocked to find one of my healthy goldfish lying belly up on the floor of the tank <br  ><br  >it did not help the one fish with the swim bladder and my third fish was unaffected by this   34 treatment  34  <br  ><br  >there are warnings on the package because of the formaldehyde it contains  however  i still had hopes for the treatment <br  ><br  >swim bladder is an extremely unpleasant fish ailment causing them to lose equilibrium and be upside down  i should have known there is no   34 treatment  34  for it  i have fed peas  daphnia and epsom salts as when fish are constipated  it may affect their swim bladder and that worked along with keeping the water very clean <br  ><br  >this is marketed for us who are desperate to help the fish regain their health and it does<br  >not work 
quality	it is very oily and greasy  i am not sure but this product might have been responsible for my dog s stomach upset  she stopped eating completely after a couple doses  i immediately discontinued giving it to her  could have been a coincidence and maybe not 
product	i have a pack of destructo labs  power chewers who can demolish almost anything   this toy can withstand their determined assault  but the problem is that none of the dogs are really interested in it  usually they love rubber toys  they love spending fifteen minutes ripping a kong toy to shreds  for some reason this toy is a dud <br  ><br  >i originally bought it as a peanut butter toy to replace the kongs  the opening is really large  though  so the peanut butter is gone in a matter of seconds  even frozen   once the yummy part is gone my girls immediately lose interest in this toy and go back to chewing the hard nylabones <br  ><br  >weird  and a little annoying  since this toy actually is durable and tough  do not know it it is the toy or my dogs  but it is a dud for us 
health	my dog food was stale and expired                my dog got sick and puked for two days before i realized that it was the new food   
product	i add this product to my aquarium and in two days most of the fish died  the fish were healthy before i add this product some of my plants turned brown too and they were nice and green before i add this product  my problem was long hair algae i thought this will help  i do not know if someone has this experience too  i am so upset and disappointed
product	i chose these treats because of the great reviews  when i opened the amazon box and saw the healthsome bag of treats  i was taken by surprise at how few treats were in the bag for what i paid  after reading the label  i figured these were more expensive because of the quality ingredients and exceptional nutritional value  okay  that must have been one of the reasons i chose to order these treats  aside from being grain free  if i provided my dog with three of these a day  the bag might last a couple of weeks  i gave my dog her daily round of goodies  along with three of these biscuits  as i write this 12 hours later  the biscuits still sit on the grass in the backyard  completely untouched  i wasted almost  5  and i made sure i canceled my   34 subscribe and save order  34  so these do not arrive again in june  maybe my cats would like these treats  it is worth a try 
product	do a quick google search to learn all you need to know about the long  sad history of tainted pet food from china  yes  my cats loved this stuff as an occasional treat sprinkled over their ultra healthy raw chicken turkey diet  no  i will never buy wild side salmon ever again  there are many healthy alternatives that are made in the usa and appropriately quality controlled  such as whole life freeze dried chicken treats  which are about the same price  and my cats like the whole life product even better 
product	out of the 12 can 5 where dented   most a little  but a couple very badly  hope next shipment is in better shape
health	i have two cats  one indoor one likes going outdoors  well advantage had worked wonderfully before so when my outdoor cat got infested with fleas this is what i resorted to  i used it on the outdoor cat and it did not even do anything  then my indoor cat got fleas and i used it on her too and even though she is completely indoors it did not work on her either  so i pretty much payed  60 bucks for something that was not even going to work  i am better off giving them flea baths  i am extremely disappointed that these do not work like they used to or that i got a bad batch some how  
product	i have no proof this stuff is actually working  my plants seem healthy but i cannot tell this stuff actually works  i do not really see the growth i was thinking i would see so i cannot say for sure this stuff actually works 
product	i ordered what i thought was a pack of 4 and got one  then was told that the price is actually  4 99 per pack plus  5 99 shipping  madness  i have bought them before in packs for around the price these were on offer so do not get ripped off  plus  while they did offer a refund  they initially tried to tell me it was my fault and i must have read the description incorrectly   what happened to the buyer being right     the biscuits themselves are 4 5  s my dog loves them  i will go back to getting them in the store  much less hassle 
product	a simple piece of cardboard with different size holes in it that my tiny cat  a 5 pound singapura  smallest of all cat breeds  flattened in a minute  i did not have time to send it back or i would have  total ripoff for the price 
quality	my bird would not eat any of the peanuts or papaya pieces  even though he likes both  the papaya was very hard and dried out  so not sure if it was stale and that is why he did not want it 
quality	i am sure that most dogs will like this  i just have 2 very picky dogs that will not eat any treat other than duck jerky  gave these to my daughters and their dogs liked them  if your dogs are not border line anorexic  like mine are   these treats should be fine 
quality	my dog does not like these    kind of disappointed that i have a giant bag of them now  otherwise they seem like a great product 
product	this is cat food for people that do not really care about their animals and are just going to feed them what ever it cheap <br  ><br  >yuck  got this bag just because i needed something in a pinch  gave my cat bad dandruff  coast it is shiny any more the ingredients are crap  the only ones that like it are the birds  never again 
product	the bird does not much like them  and the package is not much larger than a doggone pack of airline peanuts  you do not get much for the price 
product	it is much smaller than expected  i guess i did not read description  my fault  it is somewhere between the size of a tennis ball and softball  too bad they did not make it larger  delivery was on time and in good condition 
product	great quality but too expensive  look at your locaklcostco and they have the same product for 1 3rd the cost   
quality	my dog refused to eat it and i gave it to another dog which refused as well  so  i will not buy it again
product	was disappointed these were made in china  there is a big ban on dog treats from china  but my dog will only eat duck treats and i thought these were made in usa 
quality	dogs will not eat em  put peanut butter on em they lick off the pb and spit out the biscuit waste of money for me 
quality	these are soft chews so my cat would not touch them  be warned  i was under the impression from other reviews that these are crunchy  the description should be updated to prevent others from wasting    on these if  like my cat  yours will not eat a soft chew 
product	i have a pekingese mix of 1 year  one or two hours after i applied this product to him he starts to scratch and his skin gets red  i have to put a t shirt on him so he does not hurt himself  i tried to give him a bath after 48 hours  it seems to decrease the itchiness but you can see him trying to and his skin is still red and warm  so i decided to change to another product  for some dogs it might work but for others don t  i bough a package of 6 so be smart and get a smaller supplement or get a sample and try it first to see how it works in your dog 
health	i am very disappointed that these treats are made in china  are they tainted with a china antibiotic  it says   34 no antibiotics  34  on the package but does that guarantee that they do not have the drug amantadine in them <br  >info from the fda may 16  2014 stated <br  >   34 since fda’s last update on october 22  2013  we have received approximately 1 800 additional case reports  as of may 1  2014  we have received in total more than 4 800 complaints of illness in pets that ate chicken  duck  or sweet potato jerky treats  nearly all of which are imported from china  the reports involve more than 5 600 dogs  24 cats  three people  and include more than 1 000 canine deaths  the breakdown of symptoms associated with the cases is similar to that of earlier reports  approximately 60 percent of the cases report gastrointestinal liver disease  30 percent kidney or urinary disease  with the remaining 10 percent of complaints including various other signs such as neurologic  dermatologic  and immunologic symptoms  about 15 percent of the kidney or urinary cases also tested positive for fanconi syndrome  a rare kidney disease that has been associated with this investigation  34  
health	my dog is at the vet as i write this  he got sick from eating these and we do not know how bad it is yet  i called the company to ask if there was a recall and they told me yes  but could not give me more details until tomorrow  i trusted them because they say inspected in the usa  do not feed cadet brand to your dogs 
product	i have 3 cats and only one of them will eat this treat  i would not buy it for them again 
product	this is a simple concotion that as far as i can tell has vitamins  easy enough to get liquid ones instead  and a mixture of protein powder  the key    plus powdered milk and sucrose  no remarkable resuts in our old pooch and feel vets suggestion was not a good one in this case andvery costly  i think you could do better simply by letting the dog have a human version of ensure liquid booster drink  the only problem for any dog is managing slow adaption to any diet changes so as to avoid upsetting their tempermental guts and bowel is all  moderation of ensure  may a table spoon or two to start each meal   and working up to three to five times a day gave our dog a better result   heck at her age a shot of scotch might do the trick too    bottom line   if you are in a hurry and can afford it this works is all   cannot prove it didn t 
product	i think the food we give our animals causes the tartar on their teeth and the resultant expensive cleaning sure to follow  i have switched to good premium food and have chosen one without carbohydrates listed in the first three ingredients  rice  potatoes  etc  help cause the tarter  either go to a raw diet or use a premium food  it helps 
health	i do not know what is in there but it smelled distinctly of spices   herbs  like a seasoning  i did not even try to give it to my dog  cuz he has a sensitive stomach  too bad  it is a great idea 
quality	the bottom line is  if my dog turns his nose up at them  no matter how natural or healthy they are  they are of no use to me  but  usually  if he is hungry  and the treat s sitting there waiting for him for a few hours  and there is no other food choice in sight  he will eat it  but  to tell you the truth his breath is the same  perhaps one a day is simply not enough to make a difference 
product	i put this on weekly for a month  packaging says i can  and my cat is still covered in fleas  to be honest  nothing else works either 
quality	my dog refused to eat or smell these  i had to throw these away <br  ><br  >the ingredients listed on the package  lamb  salmon  ground brown rice  oatmeal  vegetable glycerin  guar gum  cane molasses  carrot  salt  natural smoke flavor  garlic powder  blueberries  flaxseed  sweet potatoes  apples  phosphoric acid  sorbic acid  preservative   and mixed tocopherols added to preserve freshness <br  ><br  >it was obvious that my dog objected to the smell  due to the \\ natural smoke flavor \\  i bought one other dog treat product online with \\ natural smoke flavor\\  and had to throw that away too <br  ><br  >i do not want companies putting things into dog food and treats that dogs do not naturally need and that may actually bad for them  and possibly us humans   never in their evolutionary history did dogs plant  harvest  process  or eat brown rice  oatmeal  vegetable glycerin  guar gum  cane molasses  carrot  salt  natural smoke flavor  garlic powder  blueberries  flaxseed  sweet potatoes  apples  phosphoric acid  sorbic acid  preservative   and mixed tocopherols added to preserve freshness <br  ><br  >but i purchased wellness pure rewards  they are expensive  but my dogs and his dog buddies love them 
health	i bought these due to   34 made in usa  34   upon opening the amazon box  a horrible odor emerged and could not believe how much these stank  i broke one piece into 3 pieces to let me 3 dogs try a piece and they all hacked on it  i threw the entire bag away cannot be good for them  the stench alone is bad enough however when our dogs became sick it was a no brainer to throw them out  never again 
product	two major complaints with this  first  it does not come apart  so to fill it you must put treats in the same small hole they come out of  this is fine if you are only going to put in a few treats  but if you want to use it for dispensing larger amounts of dry food  as meal replacement   it is a pain  second  the treats we feed our cat are in a shape that gets stuck between the inner plastic swirly part and the outer clear plastic ball  not worth the money 
health	my scottish terrier got three tick infestation after using this product and the vet told me this is  normal  and said that i should try another product  frustrated that i have lost 80 dollars 
quality	my rabbit does not eat all  skinny white seeds  corn  little white round pellets  needs more nuts  other then that for the most part he eats it
product	they sold this item like if it is was the brand   34 mazuri  34   but the product came on a sealed plastic bag with no labelled  in other words  the packaging was not as pictured  just review the comments of the rest of people who bought this product 
product	no where did it say this product was made in china  but it is  lowered my dog s immune system so much that he ended up with demodectic mange  tossed the remainder in the trash  never again 
product	    amazon did the right thing and authorized a refund on these to my account  i will see if that comes through as they promised   <br  ><br  >its a real shame these are not made in the us like a lot of dogswell products are  we have had great success with other products made in the us and even though these may be perfectly fine for the dogs  the shadiness of not disclosing that information and the fact that there is so many dog treats made out of the country that are bad for dogs  this just does not sit right with me <br  ><br  >i am going to look into these further to see if they are okay for the dogs long term  i hope they are 
quality	worms are a little stinky  and dry  and crumble between fingers easily  i usually crumble them as finely as possible because otherwise the cells absorb water and the dry line becomes a half an inch dead worm floating around fully hydrated   not a pretty sight  they are also too large for guppies to swallow unless they are crumbled first 
quality	the treats were small  the box was small  i did not think it was a good value for the price  i have two dogs  the adult dog turned her nose up at them and my 7 month old puppy ate them  i would not recommend or buy them again 
product	gave one of these to each of my border collies and thought i had a winner here   but just a few minutes later they were each able to pop one of the disks out  i jammed the treat disk back in  this time backwards thinking it would be harder to get back out  but after a few more minutes they got it out again and started chewing on it  having broken a small chunk off i felt that it would be even easier to get the disk out so they had it as a crunchy snack  for the price  definitely not worth it 
product	was a little disappointed  the last bag i bought the sticks were much bigger  thus bag all of them are thin  in no time the dog finishes them 
quality	i bought this item at a national pet store and really liked it  i order some from amazon and liked it again  i reordered and this time the product smelled really awful  ordered again  same thing  so now i am not so sure this is a good thing to feed the dogs as treats  bad smell is generally a reliable warning to avoid 
product	i have 2 cats that i have been using this on regularly for the past 3 months  the cats hate this stuff  and run at the sight of the box   the alcohol smell is terrible  so i do not blame them   at first it seemed to work fine  because their obvious discomfort  scratching and biting at their fur  went away  i got a box of the prescription revolution from the vet less than a week ago  and some dead fleas came off while i was brushing them today  i guess the advantage was not working as well as i thought it was  if it leaves some fleas untouched it really is not worth the money or the discomfort of applying it to my pets 
product	accidentally bought this toy thinking it would also be able to be a chew toy a little bit    i was wrong  as soon as i turned my back  my 1 year old australian shepherd mix pup ripped off part of the   34 leg  34     this version of west paw is a waste of money if your dog is a chewer  look for the other versions specifically for chewing  the west paw stick version holds up well to aggressive chewing 
health	my 6 month old rottie pup bit out a fairly large hunk of the ball and swallowed it within the first 10 minutes of having this  unacceptable  she still is not at full strength on her   34 big girl  34  teeth and jaws  for the price  the size   34 large  34   general description the name   34 everlasting  34   i expected more than one 10 minute chewing session before the destruction and a dangerous intake of a piece of the actual ball into my puppy s body 
product	design is pretty good and the toughness for an aggressive chewer like my little rottie pup is fine  only issue is that she does not have fun with it  she cannot roll or bounce it and it does not have any scent or taste to encourage the attempt to chew on it  putting any kind of treat in the interior is not worth the effort as she has anything  yes even frozen peanut butter  out of it and eaten much faster than the time it took me to stuff it in 
quality	i actually bought these for my cats after they had dental surgery and one of them does not seem to care for it at all while the other will eat how many i put on the plate  i have actually started monitoring her because she will eat anything you put in front of her and i do not want her to get heavy  meanwhile  my other cat literally tried it and spit it out and will not go near one 
quality	cat hated it  refused to eat it  and personally  i am a bit concerned about the carb count of this food  since many cats with bladder issues can roll over rapidly into diabetes  however   it is much better than any bladder prescription food you can buy 
quality	i thought this product was the same as   34 chick n hide  34  sticks  it is similar  but not fresh  well  at least the packages i recieved  i returned because these altho our dogs love these products  they are not cheap  be sure if you are ordering   34 chick n hide  34  sticks you look at the spelling  this product is chicken hide  i really do not like leaving negative feedback  but i am just sending out a warning to those that these are not the same as chick n hide 
product	bought this used from amazon warehouse deals  and it was missing the lid  the only problem i have  besides amazon sending me two of these by mistake  and not sending me the lid for it  was that the food does not really   34 drop  34  down on it is own  my cat will eat all of the food out of the dispenser area  and i will sort of have to scoop pull down some more food from the canister occasionally  that is my only complaint  otherwise it works well 
product	i got the hock version for my lab puppy and it lasted for about a month which was awesome  i ordered this one hopping for something similar but he had it destroyed in a few hours so i was rather disappointed  but he had fun eating it so it served its purpose 
product	i just received this product along with several others  i opened it   gave my dogs some  they loved it  and when i closed it i noticed on the reverse of the package it is made in china   i do not buy any pet food products made in china  <br  >how did i miss it  <br  > it seems i did not miss it because it is not part of the product description  <br  >i did purchase it because of it is reviews and it also had a 4 1 2 star rating with almost 200 customer reviews   for me that is always a good sign  <br  >as i see had i read further i probably would have seen that in the customer reviews it mentions many times made in china   but shame on me for not doing so  <br  ><br  >that being said i am very disappointed that the country of origin is not displayed as it should be on all food items regardless of whether they are for our pets or ourselves <br  ><br  >i feel fooled   but i will not be fooled again 
product	it is hard to know exactly what my dog thinks of these treats but he does not go crazy for them like he normally would when i reach for the package 
quality	bella did not like these very much  she did not eat very many of them  she likes sweet potato but not this brand  would not buy them again 
quality	i wanted to get a healthy treat for my dog but she will not eat them at all  she is been used to milk bone soft   chewy and loves them  i bought two bags of 2 different flavors and i am going to have to give them away  i will not be buying these anymore  maybe she is just a   34 fast food  34  junkie     i thought these would be better for her  sigh   but  ya just gotta try

product	but not worth the price  this is the only product i have received from amazon that i did not think was a good value      
product	of natural balance treats seem very pricety  probably will buy them on a very limited basis  the treat is good  or at least my dogs think so  just very expensive 
quality	this food helped my fat cats lose weight  but i think it was because they hated it and did not eat as much  when i put them back on the regular hill s food  it was like they had been in a concentration camp  the food has kind of a funny smell to it  also  cats are smart  you cannot fool them  the kibbles may look like the same thing  but i am sure they do not taste the same 
quality	not sure why but my cats will not eat these  my boy cat loves his treats but he will not eat these  my girl cat showed a little more interest in them but she has never been a big treat eater 
quality	been using poodle 30 for many years  6   and the dogs loved this food <br  >bought this and they will not eat it <br  ><br  >new bag is labeled \\ poodle adult\\  not poodle 30 as shown on amazon <br  ><br  >check out the ingredients on the new bag <br  ><br  >corn  brewers rice  wheat gluten <br  >chicken by product meal  chicken fat   <br  ><br  >5 6 14<br  >contacted royal canin and they indeed changed poodle 30 
product	i do not know if i overlooked the ingredients or they changed them  my dog used to love these and ignores them today <br  >1 thing i generally look for 1st is protein content  it is 1     i cannot believe i bought a product that has only 1  protein  product ingredients are listed by biggest quantity 1st    wheat starch  is the biggest ingredient  the box lists things they do not add like sugar and that they do add some vitamins and minerals but only 1  protein <br  >they may be ok for an occasional treat    but there must be better choices <br  >the bones lack what my research suggests are healthy ingredients that should be there  i am reading dr  karen becker s   34 real food for healthy dogs   cats  34  and dr  william campbell douglass   34 what does your dog really want to eat   the complete  cook  book for your dog  34 <br  >i am going to start reading more labels and finding better choices  i will not buy these again 
product	my cat likes the treats  but they are in big 3 4  34  pieces  when i tried to break or cut them into small pieces  i could get some smaller pieces but i also got a lot of crumbs and powder  maybe for a larger dog where you only break it in half it might be okay  but for the price there was a lot of waste for me trying break up  i guess you could soak them in water to rehydrate them  but it is kind of expensive for just giving regular turkey  this was true for both the chicken and turkey  i will be opening up the beef soon and will review that one 
health	this did not help our dog s ear infection clear up  she has chronic ear infections  so we have tried lots of different things

quality	this might be could food  but my 16 year old cat  for whom i bought this for  will not eat it  i got this because other reviewers has said that their old cat that had also lost their teeth would eat this so i decided to give t a try as we are having problems getting him to eat  when i first got it and opened the bag he seem excited about it and did eat some two different times after that he would eat it anymore <br  >it might be a good product but with my experience with it an my old cat   that is why i only gave it 2 stars 
product	this works  but it is big not very flexible  not so easy to open  but easy to close   and has pockets that are not really very useful in addition to the main pocket  all in all  overkill 
quality	my cat does not like this food at all  sometimes she will just flat out refuse to eat it  i will not purchase again  i guess there is no accounting for taste 
product	i should have paid more attention to the size  this was a rip off for sure  do not buy this just run up to the store 
quality	my cats did not like this flavor of meow mix they do like the other flavours so i thought to try the souffles as a new flavours but all my 3 persian cats walked away   did not even tast it 
quality	while the idea is great  i found the item to be overpriced for a cardboard box with holes  my cats were able to smell the treats and were keenly interested initially  but they lost interest after being unable to coax any treats from the maze  they could get a treat to a hole if it was not deep into the maze  but the box s design made it difficult to pull it through  the box sat without any attention for a week and i retrieved the treats and threw away the box  might be fun for hamsters or gerbils to play in  but i do not recommend it for cats 
quality	my 18 year old cat does not do much these days  not even catnip works on her  she spends her days staring at a wall  mostly  i got this because i googled   34 best cat toy  34  in hopes of giving her something to do  but she was not interested whatsoever  she stared at it  back to me  then back at the wall  i put the treat on top  she ate it  then back to the wall  so i tried to put the treat in one of the holes  and she looked at me like   34 what am i supposed to do with that   34  back to the wall  oh well  i will give it to my mom s younger cat and see how that goes 
product	nice looking bag  zippers not very easy to zip  but the disappointment was shoulder strap broke at the metal clasp when i put it together after it arrived  i needed a bag for travel immediately so i kept it  my dog loved it 
quality	i had to throw the last order of packages out  the bones were much too hard  previous ones no problem  i will no longer purchase these for my maltipoo 
product	i know there are other places on amazon to rate damaged products however i would like to warn others that this item came to me in an envelope   not a box with protective bubble wrap two of the four snacks were smashed to pieces  not sure if it left the seller that way or got damaged in transit my parakeets loved the remaining two   so i did not want to bring the product rating down too much just a bit of advice to share 
health	my vizsla pit mix became very ill from this flavor of natural balance  she has had almost all the other flavors besides bison  and she has been fine  but after 2 meals she threw up and had liquid bowel movements for days   i would strongly recommend getting a small bag and monitoring your dogs reaction  she also became very itchy most likely because she was allergic to some chemical and began to incessantly lick clean her belly and paws 
product	could not find not made in china rawhide chews locally anymore   don t know what happened to them   was pleased to find these on amazon  like others have stated  though  some dogs  like our big guy golden retriever  is expecting lots of these at a time in place of the substantial chews he is used to getting  he is so eager  too  that he will try to swallow these before he is really had a chance to chew them well  and we are constantly having to reach down his throat and pulling out pieces before he gags them back up  such a goofy guy he is  these will have to do until non chinese made rawhide chews appear back on the shelves 
quality	my finicky dog loves freeze dried liver of any kind but will not touch this  i am disappointed  it is the dog s opinion to rate 3 stars  he said if he liked it he would give it 5 
health	the cans were dented and the food was tainted  after my dog grew very sick we discovered that all of the food was tainted  i have bought this food from another distributor before but this was the first time i have bought from this company  the purina food is great  but the problems we had were tied directly to the distributor    
quality	i thought these would be a good thing for my little maltese  he loves the regular milk bone biscuits so much and i trust milk  bone because i have never heard of any recalls  well  the smell even from the unopened box was awful  i immediately threw them away  they smelled like some kind of resin or something  i did not like the ingredient list either i will not buy them again 
health	holy cow   wal mart has these for 10 98  my two hound dogs love these  they tell me they are made in the usa so they know they will not get sick
quality	my dogs will not eat them  not sure why but they are not interested in the bones  maybe flavorless  silly pups 
health	as i am reading reviews here  i am seeing so many similar ones    34 cats love this  34     34 cats say thanks  34       they read almost like ads for science diet  i am not sure what to think  my cats have been eating science diet optimal care for 5  years  i have never had a problem until this last bag i ordered  two of my three cats have been vomited  not hair balls   one of them is acting a bit lethargic  and i noticed the last couple of days that they have been drinking unusual amounts of water  i am worried about them and i am planning on speaking with my vet soon  as to the food itself  it is very oily   much more so than previous bags i have purchased  it smells different too  i read in a previous review that hill s changed their formula in 2012  but i have never had a problem until now  2014   so i am not sure what is going on  i am worried about my cats and i hope this food is not harming them 
health	i have been using it for some time now and it relieves my bitch s ear chronic infection  not a cure though  
health	he scratched and scratched and chewed it little skin to pieces  so we had to switch to evo  my vet recommended this food and i guess it was good   my puppy was just allergy prone
product	i cannot really rate it since it is cat food but my cat likes it  it has a fresh color and not dry 
product	they advertise that it is 60 oz of witakraft treat mini pop for birds  but it is only 6 oz   it is a very large difference between what they advertise and what you get      i will never buy from them  i am surprised that amazon uses them as a resource 
quality	i was very disappointed with this purchase i have bought these bones online because of the convenience the last 2 times the majority of the bones were broken what a waste my lil guys are very picky and do not like to eat broken pieces there must be a handling problem with these bones when i go to the pet store i do not have this problem 
product	great way of feeding treating dog but broke after not too long  the inside  hard plastic ball just completely broke after a couple months  the softer outer shell is great though for keeping the noise down when batted around  it is not too expensive so will probably repurchase 
quality	my dog loved these at first and now he will not touch them  shame  because mom loves them  i do not end up with treats all over the bottom of the purse  sometimes i almost mistake it for chapstick  though 
product	i discovered my local high end grocery store charges  1 99 for one container  you charged 6 95  how do spel rip off  even the 8 count boxes are more expensive  17 99 8  2 25 each  boy do i feel ripped off  i had assumed that amazon prices were lower than buying items in stores  my bad i will now check every item in local stores  i glad to know i can shop local on more items
product	that is what my dogs apparently think about these because i have 2 labs and a golden and none of them would eat these  not sure why they disliked them so but it was a waste of money 
quality	the food pellets are very small   they are only a quarter of an inch long  and they are hard as a rock  my cat sniffed this food  but he would not eat it  i think the food pellets were too small for him to pick up with his mouth  he also did not like the way it smelled  this is not grain free  ingredients include barley and white rice  any canned cat food is better than this  canned cat food gives your cat the moisture they need to stay healthy 
quality	my chi   min pin would not touch this  it had no aroma  i tried adding gravy  treats    no interest at all 
health	my dog loves them but she gets sick  the   34 made in china  34  products are extremely bad for dogs <br  ><br  >why cannot the us make duck jerky like this without the poisons  bad bacteria  in them <br  >i d pay more if i could find a duck jerky that would not slowly kill my dog 
product	even as i watched  my 1 yr old loved it and was successful in destroying it in about 25 mins  what a complete waste of money 
product	3 bags were delivered to my home on 4 23           package reads best by 4 30 14      come on     <br  >my dog will not be eating all three bags in one week <br  >he deserves a fresher product      btw    these are not cheap    <br  >starting to wonder if amazon and the makers of this product are looking out for the consumer <br  >you are the ones who have the access to the product and use by dates <br  ><br  >      plan on buying a different treat at a local reputable pet store      not a mother hubbard brand     <br  ><br  >btw      the item that was shipped with these treats was problematic as well  i have already expressed my disappointment in a separate comment for that       don t know if i will continue to visit and order from amazon site    
product	be aware    the outside of the boxes were not damaged but the blue ff boxes all had pack dented cans 
product	i would have given the cat food 5 stars as it is dependably good  however  this time the cans in the case were all dented and one was torn open  the food inside was smelly  i do not know if this was a shipping problem or an amazon problem  let us hope it does not happen again 
product	i am vegan and a professional groomer and i wanted to treat my clients doggies with vegan treats  however i was disappointed to read in the ingredients that there is gelatin in them  and since they were advertised as vegan i took their word for it and bought it without reading the reviews  the 2 stars are only because the doggies like them any way 
product	my dogs love this  they get so excited when i pull out this bag    however it is made in china  i purchased a smaller bag of these treats originally in a local cvs and it said on the bag  made in usa  but this bag  from amazon says made in china  maybe i can find more at cvs   
health	very addictive treats  my yorkie acted crazy to get more  however  i stared noticing some unusual vomiting and stopped this treats for a couple of weeks  as of today  i wanted to give her a reward and went on putting my hands inside the bag without looking first  what a surprise    treats are rotten already  this will be what you are going to feed your pets  expiration date is not until jun 2016  this product or date offering online is a counterfeited product or else extremely dangerous to your pets no matter from where you are buying it 
health	good brand but it was small than i expected  i mean i know it clearly says small  but it is really small  it will be great for puppy days  but could become a choking hazard later on 
quality	my dog eats this when there is not other treats available  for some reason he does not like biscuit like treats and this is no exception
health	i gave this to my dog who is a medium strength chewer  within a few minutes i noticed that a fairly large very sharp edged piece had fragmented off and he was trying to carry the piece away  i am glad i caught it  any treat that can fragment into such sharp pieces is absolutely not acceptable as a dog chew toy becuase the sharp edges can become very hazardous when swallowed <br  ><br  >avoid 
health	my in laws had a flea infestation  so i don  tknow if these worked  i know they would work better if you take more than 1 per week 
product	this seed has about 90  of the seed for a small hookbill  it shows a large bird on the package but the seed is not suited well for big birds  many other people stated the same but thought i would give it a try  will not buy again 
quality	my cats do not like the pill pockets but my dog loves the pill pockets so i just put my dogs pills and gave them to her
product	i rescued a new 5 year old cat  that came from a questionable home prior  and i wanted to be sure to protect him and my older cat  17 years old  from any fleas the new cat might be carrying  the younger cat reacted fine  the older cat not so much  unfortunately 2 days later his hair had completely fallen out in the spot where this was applied  and his skin was bleeding irritated  a very expensive er vet trip later  he was fine with it just being cleaned up and some mild cortizone cream applied  i called the 800   to let them know this happened and find out if this kind of reaction was common  the woman said does   34 occasionally  34  happen with some cats  obviously some cats have no problem with this  as my younger one didnt   but if you have an older cat  even without known sensitive skin issues   i would not recommend buying this  interestingly  customer service did not even suggest i might be refunded for this product 
quality	i usually give my cat blue wilderness food and thought i would mix it up and give this a try  to my understanding  this brand is supposed to be top quality like blue  but my cat refused to eat it  he turned his nose to it and would not even eat one bite  i then put blue food in his bowl  different flavor than usually gets  and he ate it all up  not sure what it is about this cat food  but my cat would not eat it so i cannot recommend at all 
health	i have used frontline for years to keep fleas and ticks away but decided to try advantix ii because it promised to also repel mosquitoes and flies  which would be nice as we hike through the woods <br  ><br  >not long after i applied the advantix my dog began scratching  then scratching more and more  we took her to the vet and he found nothing  pronounced it   34 allergies  34  and advised that we treat her with an antihistamine  the antihistamine helped  but when her next treatment was due we treated her with frontline instead of advantix  then we quit giving her the antihistamine  and the scratching did not resume  in fact  she has never scratched aggressively again <br  ><br  >though the vet thought it was unlikely that the advantix caused the scratching  we have not seen him since he diagnosed   34 allergies  34    i will not use it on her again  it is not worth the gamble 
product	same as the other reviewer  it was advertised as a 5 pack when i ordered it  i also only received one bag  contacted customer service and they agreed to send another order to replace the first  guess what  when i received the second order  it was also only 1 bag  had to goto ups twice to return them and they would do nothing about my wasted time and effort  one small bag of cat food for 16   that is crazy when this is less than 5 at walmart  very disappointed 
product	also  compared to other puzzles it does get kibble everywhere  if you are ok with that and do not have white carpet  should be fine  my little dog emptied it in 5 minutes so it was a very expensive diversion 
product	i got this bag to replace an old  worn out treat bag  i have used it twice and it has fallen off my belt 5 times during normal walking  the clip is absolute junk  also  the drawstring is placed and sewn into the bag in such a strange manner that it takes both hands and excessive force to close the top even halfway  the overall material seems sturdy enough and the bag is large enough butt it remains useless 
product	not at all impressed by this toy  i cut treats to fit through opening  but they would not dispense well  my dog could not shake them out easily   which meant he was quickly got bored and i was annoyed at the expense  the hard plastic material cracked in a few places and there were shards   i just threw it away eventually 
product	these things have become ungodly expensive over the last 1 1 2 years  this was a good price for such a large bag  trouble is  most of the pieces are tiny  there are only   34 some  34  big ones  my dog gets so excited over  the weight  of a big one and seems disappointed with the teensy ones  i think it is a good deal  but wish they were the same size as the smaller bags i get at the grocery <br  ><br  >my dog loves these things but loves even more the pizzle sticks  and we who are in the know realize those are cow penises  so lets price them like that  smokehouse      in my grocery they went from  10 pkg to over  20 pkg  i love my dog  but not that much  keep the prices for 16 ounces of any dog treat under 10  please 
quality	poor quality  not airtight as advertised  opening hinged lid  entire lid pries off when opening  thin plastic not worth the money 
quality	although the ad is listed as an american<br  >made product  the package lists the product is made from animals from<br  >severs foreign countries  it smells terrible <br  >and in 8 years  it is the only treat my<br  >dog refuses to eat 
quality	poor quality  not airtight as advertised  opening hinged lid  entire lid pries off when opening  thin plastic not worth the money 
product	more expensive than other brands <br  >not just chicken  has sodium phosphate  salt and carrageenan in it <br  ><br  >super disappointing <br  ><br  >whole life makes a dehydrated   freeze dried chicken for cats and dogs that is great  i did not love the packaging because their were a lot of crumbles at the bottom  there are crumbles in the halo brand  but now that i have tested 2 brands  i will buy the other one in the future  as well as give them a glowing review  
quality	i do not know which cans are safe to feed and which are not  the ones with oozing food are a definite no  but what about the others  some make an airy sound when squeezed  so i will toss them too  but i am frankly afraid to feed the dented ones to my cats at all  i have had a subscription for this for the past 4 months and nearly every time there are multiple cans to throw away  i gave feedback on the poor packaging earlier  but these came dented with no protection from the side  is amazon reading their own packaging feedback  i order several cases at a time  so i realize they are heavy  but they cannot survive the rough handling of shipment so amazon needs to provide better protection  i will be cancelling my subscription for these ones 
product	the last two packages we ordered came with most of the nuggets completely crushed  it is still edible  and we used it  but our bird cannot pick them up and nibble them since it is just a bag of seeds and pellets  we will try ordering one more time  but if they come crushed again  i will spend more and get them from the pet store 
quality	my cat loves these in the salmon flavor  but they are much lower in glucosamine and chondroitin  and have no msm at all  than other products  i wish they had as high a dose of these ingredients as pet naturals hip   joint  which my cat does not like  but in the few days he would eat them  worked much better than zukes hipaction   for comparison  hipaction only has 50 mg glucosamine and 15 mg of chondroitin per treat  pet naturals has 100 mg glucosamine and 50 mg chondroitin plus 50 mg msm per treat 
health	we have a 10 yr old yellow lab that 130 lbs he eats anything  but does not care for this food  we also have a 4 yr old pitbull   she will not eat it either  the kibble size is much larger than other foods we have been using   i thought it was grain free but looking back   the page it does not say <br  ><br  >we have had good response in the past with hill products  our vet always recommended them if they were sick  the hounds give it a tails down on this one 
health	my dog was sick from this product and just saw the news recently about the chicken jerky shipped from china  do not feed this to your dog  i had to take my dog to the vet as he as vomiting after eating this product 
quality	i do not like it  my cocker spaniel was not able to take that treat out  i did it  it is too hard and not flexible 
product	my wheaten terrier loves these treats  more then any of the others i can give him <br  ><br  >i always look for treats that are made in the usa  i also look for treats that i feel are raised humanly  i do not know if these treats are made from cattle that are raised on grass  allowed to roam on farms that they can have freedom to be bovine animals  or not  i can only hope they are <br  ><br  >one of the dilemmas of being a vegetarian  but responsible for a dogs and cats <br  ><br  >that leaves me with how do i rate this product   good for packaging  good for quality  good for flavor as my dog loves them  good for being made in the usa  not so good as i do not know how cattle were raised and treated <br  ><br  > so i can only give it 3 stars 
product	my dog hates them <br  ><br  >by the way you cannot return this item <br  ><br  >don t waste your  25  on this <br  ><br  >what a disappointment 
product	i used to order this for my dog who would eat these like they were going out of style  but then the price kept jumping up   they were about  19 a yr ago  but now they are almost  32  i am not sure if it is stewart who keeps jacking up the price or if it is amazon  but anyways it is no longer a bargain <br  ><br  >so i ended up getting their competitor purebites  which supposedly only gives you 16 6 oz vs the 21 oz for stewart s  but i found that the 16 oz from purebites filled up the whole stewart s tub  meaning i was paying for the weight of stewart s plastic bottle  what a ripoff <br  ><br  >in short  i will stick with purebites which only charges you for the weight of the beef liver  unlike stewart s which charges you for the weight of it is plastic bottle  you will end up with the same amount of beef liver but you will save your self some money with the purebites  it is ridiculous that stewart s charges people for the weight of the packaging and not just of the beef liver  see ya stewart s 
quality	the cat seems to like it well enough  but it eats everything  this food stinks up the house like no other 
quality	i am continuing to use this supplement but not sure it is really working  have a cat with a runny bowel problem and it seems to be working for a while then she has another episode  seems to be a bit better when using this supplement 
quality	i bought this dog food for my yorkie mix  i allowed 7 days for mixing it in with her other food gradually as suggested on bag  sage would eat her regular food  while picking out the little chunks of hill s science and drop them on the floor away from her bowl  after a week  i tested to see what would happen with only the hill s in her bowl  not only would she not eat it  she did the bury it with her nose motion  she went 2 days without eating anything 
quality	we have ordered zuke s g zees before in salmon flavor and both our cats both enjoyed them very much  however  one of them will not touch the turkey flavor treats  her sister likes the turkey ones  but not nearly as much as the salmon <br  ><br  >fyi  our cats are around 10 yrs old  one has arthritis in the hips and the other broke her foot a few months ago  judging by the way the kitty with arthritis walks when she is been taking glucosamine  it seems she feels a little less joint stiffness  i like to give them glucosamine in \\ treat\\  form because it is a nice thing they enjoy in the evening  i am not really sure how much glucosamine they are getting in the zuke s treats   i hope it is enough to help them  i usually give them four or five g zees per day 
quality	i have a picky kitty and he definitely does not care for this food  i am sure it is very healthy but i had to give this away since my kitty turned his nose up and refused to eat it 
product	these treats are hard to find and my dog loves them  i love that they are made in the usa  i will not order them on line again because even though the treat box was undamaged and they were packed nicely by amazon  the treats inside the box were crushed  it was a mess  i opened the box and dumped everything into a baggie  this product is already pricey and i feel like i lost half of the product to actual crumbs that cannot even be fed to my dog  i feel lthis was a three dog bakery quality control issue since the box was undamaged  but imagine someone stepping on the box of treats and that is what the product was like inside the box  i felt i would pay more for return shipping and it was not worth the hassle to return 
product	these treats are hard to find and my dog loves them  i love that they are made in the usa  i will not order them on line again because even though the treat box was undamaged and they were packed nicely by amazon  the treats inside the box were partially crushed  it was very messy  this product is already pricey and i feel like i lost about a third of the product to actual crumbs that cannot even be fed to my dog  i feel lthis was a three dog bakery quality control issue since the box was undamaged  i felt i would pay more for return shipping and it was not worth the hassle to return 
health	i want to thank you  i was getting it cheaper at walmart  but today you lowered your prices and that is a very big help   i rescue dogs  and many dogs eat your food   with no one ever getting sick or turning away  thank you
product	gave this item only 1star since my dog did not enjoy this item     chewed briefly and then abandoned it entirely 
health	this is not the same product you can get at your local pet store  the same item at your pet store is a clean white fish that crumbles when you touch it  my dogs loved it  i ordered what i thought was exactly the same item through amazon  the price was awesome  the quality  however  is horrendous  the amazon product is brown  not white pieces of fish  the fish smells stale and is tough  it does not crumble like the store bought product  even so  my dogs ate the first bag without incident  the second and third bags purchased through amazon made my dogs sick  diarreah  and now they will not touch it  over  40 wasted  please do not risk getting your dogs sick or wasting your money 
health	at first  harley loved these because he thought he was getting the peanut butter ones i usually gave his salmon oil in  but he wised up  and so did i  the duck   pea formula is ghastly  the smell is so bad and lingered on my fingers  blech   so i started using a hospital glove to make it into a ball after i stick the capsule in  i am changing my selection to another flavor 
quality	sounds like a nice idea  and probably some guinea pigs will eat them but ours will not touch them at all     
quality	with toys  treats  food and litter  cat people know that felines can be finicky so reviews need to be taken with a grain of salt  my particular cat children did not care for these treats but i believe this to be a good brand and a good product 
quality	my 25 pound dog will not eat it  these seem to be the reasons  1  the pieces are too large  2  the pieces do not taste good  i am sure that is intended   still i love my dog enough to want him to enjoy his dinner  i do realize that with this attitude one has to be very careful not to overfeed the animal 
product	i have two dogs and neither one likes this dry version of chef michael s  i was disappointed that they stopped the wet food in the cans   my dogs liked that one  i bought the dry thinking it would be similar   it isn t  the peas look like peas  but the beef part of the food looks very artificial  neither one of my dogs will eat this stuff 
product	based on the advertised ingredients and the price  i was expecting to be giving my cat a treat  she eats it but she was hardly excited  not worth the cost by any means 
quality	i was so excited to receive these from the reviews  i opened the container and my dog got all excited  i held it out for him  he smelled it and walked away  i put it on the floor and my other dog did not touch it either  it is still on the floor untouched 
health	these kingdom pets chicken jerky wraps made all three of my shepherds sick so i stopped buying them  wish amazon would stop selling them  many reports have been made that kingdom pets chicken jerky is harmful to dogs 
quality	i do not like it   my dog does not like it either  however it is maybe better for a medium large sized dog    it is a bad grip for a small dog    wish the description was clear when i bought it    
product	this is the first time that i have ordered this direct from amazon  been giving these treats to my dogs for years  i was disappointed in the freshness this time  these have obviously been sitting on someones shelf for a long time  but i will re order again because of the convenience 
product	i did not want to give this item any stars  but it could not be rated unless it got at least one star  we have only had the buster treat dispenser for dogs for about a month  my dog has only used it about a half a dozen times  and it has broken neatly in half  the previous one we had lasted for over 8 years  with lots of rough play  the new one  made in china of very cheap material that made it difficult to adjust the treat hole  fell into two pieces after minimal use  this was an expensive toy  especially if you include shipping  i would love my money refunded 
quality	i have been buying these treats from amazon for years and they are great  my yorkie loves them  however  the last 3 packs have been rock hard  amazon needs to ensure they keep these in good quality   otherwise i will have to start buying from somewhere else   
health	the product was completely changed from what i had been getting  i have a dog with a sensitive stomach and did not have enough left from my last bag to be able to change gradually  even if i had wanted to  i did not like the look or smell of the new product  which came in the same bag and had the same name as the former product  i cannot leave my house at will  so i was stuck with having to make an immediate switch to my other dog s unsuitable food until i could get to my vet  this company has done the same thing in the past  that is  changed ingredients without changing the name of the product  and the only way i would have known was by comparing the list of ingredients on the former product with that of the new product  i have gone back to the healthy advantage oral  which is now the product  with a new name  that i was feeding my dog before i switched to oral care  unfortunately i can get healthy advantage oral only from a vet  i wish i could find some other brand  but i do not want to try new foods because of the toll it would take on my dog stomach and on my finances 
quality	i have honestly tried with these treats  my yorkie loves them  he is a finicky eater  drives me nuts however i only feed him the best  i waste at least 96  of the bag because they are too hard   i do not understand why they have to make them as hard as a rock  from the reviews i have read i am not the only one with issues regarding their texture <br  >now my baby has broke 2 teeth clean off on these treats   i am done 
health	horrible scary bones    they splinter immediately into dagger like shards     i took the bone away from my big girl and threw it along with the rest of the package away  these are obviously really dangerous   34 treats  34  and should not be sold 
health	i bought this on the recommendation of my dog friends for my corgi s chronic ear problem  unfortunately it was not useful for the most recent bout   ended up with a severe infection  cannot say it was because of this  but it sure did not help 
quality	my ct no so crazy about the product  does not care for thi fish dinners so i thought he might enjoy this  he will eat it under duress  however  all the cans arrived dented  along w the other products i ordered 
quality	although they are not past the   34 sell by date  34  they are close to that date  they seem very hard and dried out  the ones you purchase in the store are soft and chewy
product	two of my cats like these treats  one doesn t  i would not buy them again  just simply because my cats are not picky about normal treats 
product	i am most disappointed thus time as i have had to dose my dog at 2 week intervals due to fleas  i hoped that this was just a bad month for fleas  itcan get awfully expensive  in the past i would normally use a capstar pill along with advantix ii and never had a problem  this month i was short on funds and opted for the advantix only as the capstar costs just as much  won t do that again  
health	i tried semi raw  but my cat was not overly enthusiastic  she likes canned nature s variety rabbit so i thought i would create a homemade beef   pork liver recipe using this version of tcfeline  she likes it better  i am thinking once she gets used to these supplements  i may try semi raw again using this version of the premix  the larger size is twice as economical so hopefully her tastes do not change like it did half way through the trial of the plus liver version  here s my recipe <br  ><br  >chop 3 5 oz pork liver using food processor  use gloves and maybe a mask smelly  to reduce the ick factor   mix the liver  2 eggs  2 lbs ground beef  i highly recommend very low fat beef like laura s lean beef   1 tablespoon frozen peas carrots  1 teaspoon ground flax seed  mix very well  bake covered at 375 for approx 1 hr 20 mins  very important  put the baking dish in the refrigerator freezer until nice and cold  not frozen   you should not mix the tcfeline with hot meat since it may reduce the effectiveness of the supplements  in separate bowl  mix up the tcfeline supplement  1 cup water and 2 1oz of mix   use food processor to chop up the cold meat cake so it is a softer consistency  your cat might like the tough parts  but mine likes it minced   this will break up the flax seeds and peas and carrots as well  add the chopped meat mix to the tcfeline supplement and it is now ready to serve and or freeze  be sure to check the calorie content of your meat so you are feeding appropriate amount  for ex  at 9 5 lbs  amber should be eating around 285 calories per day depending on her activity level <br  ><br  >updated 4 26 14  my poor kitty has started to get loose stools  the remnants of which end up on the floor   i thought maybe it was this mix but it was happening even after i stopped feeding it to her  my theory now is that it is the high fat content in the nature s variety instinct canned food that i was also feeding her  my suggestion is that you stick to low fat ground beef like laura s lean beef when making this recipe <br  ><br  >updated 8 22 14  kitty s stomach issues have continued  loose stools and hair balls   i am afraid she has ibd which makes her a great candidate for raw feeding  unfortunately  she will not touch the tcfeline mix  no matter the chicken liver or original flavor  they both smell the same so she just does not eat it  i stuck to the nature s variety rabbit canned and now am feeding her the raw rabbit raw bites which are made using high pressure process which reduces the bacteria  for those of you who d like to transition from canned to raw  i would recommend nature s variety instead of jumping into this mix  especially if the cat likes those flavors <br  ><br  >on a side note  i wanted to say that the comments below about not cooking homemade food were discouraging  cooking the meat using a pre mix should be seen as a transitional phase to raw  the fact that i was trying to feed my cat whole foods rather than commercial should have been encouraged more and i believe should be encouraged by the makers of this product  practice not perfection nd beef like laura s lean beef when making this recipe <br  ><br  >updated 8 22 14  kitty s stomach issues have continued  loose stools and hair balls   i am afraid she has ibd which makes her a great candidate for raw feeding  unfortunately  she will not touch the tcfeline mix  no matter the chicken liver or original flavor  they both smell the same so she just does not eat it  i stuck to the nature s variety rabbit canned and now am feeding her the raw rabbit raw bites which are made using high pressure process which reduces the bacteria  for those of you who d like to transition from canned to raw  i would recommend nature s variety instead of jumping into this mix  especially if the cat likes those flavors <br  ><br  >on a side note  i wanted to say that the comments below about not cooking homemade food were discouraging  cooking the meat using a pre mix should be seen as a transitional phase to raw  the fact that i was trying to feed my cat whole foods rather than commercial should have been encouraged more and i believe should be encouraged by the makers of this product  practice not perfection 
health	i just saw that on package and also another member revied it stating this <br  ><br  >  34 <br  >the active ingredient in these is petroleum  a substance which blocks the absorption of minerals in the cats intestines  this information is cleverly not disclosed on the amazon website  used to the degree stated on this package especially long term is unwise to any cats health  greenies are no different than temptation s hairball formula  if you love your cat you will seek other ways to control hairballs  better options are to brush your cat regularly  add natural oils to their diet like a little olive oil  oil from your tuna  not water packed kind   feed one sardine a month or butter her paw 
product	too dry  when you try to collapse the pocket around the pill  it crumbles into pieces  the chicken and beef are much better  i will not buy this product again  f 
quality	my dogs love these treats  but seeing as the company has recently been purchased by nestle purina i will no longer be buying zuke s for my dogs  i do not believe that purina is as concerned about the health of my pets as the original zuke s line was  purina brand has had too many recalls and bad press  i just avoid them all together now when it comes to pet food or treats <br  ><br  >i believe it will be a matter of time     perhaps a year or two before the ingredients change to a cheaper alternative 
product	our cats love this food  but i want to warn others that this item seems to be frequently damaged in transit  we just received two packs of this food  and half the cans were crushed to the point of being completely open  and dripping spoiled cat food all over the box  yuck   if you look at other reviews  you will find many others with the same experience 
quality	my cat did not eat them  in fact  he spit them back out  i was disappointed  was hoping that this would be a great way to get him to take his wormer medicine  normally he eats anything  but they did have a strong odor when first opening the package  not sure if that was a turn off to him 
product	the metal hinge fittings came apart the third time i used this  i tried to get the mfg  to send replacement parts  but they said they couldn t  so it is useless now 
product	disappointed that these treats are made in china  it seems like a good company like dogswell could get jerky treat made in usa 
health	i am giving this product a \\ i do not like it\\  rating becasue my dogs were attracted to the bones and started knawing at them right away  i walked away to come back to splinter like pieces on the floor  i just hope by dogs do not get hurt by these  i am not to informed on dog treats too much but i will definitly knock these off my list  too dangerous 
health	not sure what was in this but it made both my dogs sick and they can eat anything  they both threw up after eating this  i know it was this since they had nothing else new  it went right in the garbage  i was surprised since i feed them both wet and dry natural balance dog food 
quality	this was great when i first had to begin giving my cat a daily pill  make it simple  so i ordered a six pack  since the cat will be on medication permanently  naturally  the cat then decided she does not like the pill pocket 
product	i have bought these twice now  from this particular vendor  they shipped promptly but i am very disappointed with the product  the pill pockets are almost dry and crumbly   the pocket falls apart when inserting the pill  i have not even finish the first package and my dog refuses to take them <br  >i ve used pill pockets for years and they were always moist and held onto the pill nicely  but this vendor must have very old stock  this time i purchased peanut butter  the last order was chicken both flavors have been too dry to hold a pill  now i am stuck with five pkgs  that i cannot use 
quality	my dogs will not eat them     they just stare at them and smell them one dog hid it i under his bed lol
health	my vet put one of my cats on the hill s prescription diet for urinary health  c d  after discovering she had a bladder infection  so i looked on amazon and found this hill s science diet for senior cats  and decided to get it for my other cats  a brand reccommended by vets  this must be good  right  my cat on the prescription diet was slowly transitioned to the new food as reccommended  and was doing fine until she starting eating 75    of the new food  i woke up in the middle of the night to her vomiting up the kibble  and she continued to vomit and have dry heaves off and on most of the night  i thought maybe she just ate too much  too fast  so the next day i limited the amount she got at a time  and spread the food out so she could not inhale it  it did not help  every time she ate it  she threw it back up  my other cats were in the process of transitioning to the science diet senior  and one of them also started throwing up every time they tried to eat the food  same company  hill s   2 different varieties of their food  prescription c d  science diet senior plus   and 2 very sick kitties  i took the prescription diet back to my vet and they gave her the royal canin urinary health  which so far she is eating with no problems  my other cats went right back to the earthborn holistic food i had them on  i wish i never tried switching  i feed my akita earthborn holistic dog food which is rated 4 5 stars out of 5  the hill s brand dog food is rated 2 5 stars    hmmm  somehow i am not surprised  this is obviously poor quality food posing as high end  buyer beware 
quality	cannot you smell that smell <br  >the dogs seem to like these but they stink like 3 day old steaming duck carcass  they are also oily so the smell transfers to your hand  i would not purchase again 
health	my two dogs loved these  but my concern was how chewy they were    every time i gave one to my little dogs they would gag while trying to chew them up  i ended up breaking them into tiny pieces every time i fed them to my dogs for fear of them getting choked on them 
quality	tidy cat is just a regular litter and it will stink in a few days  i tried a new litter made of crystals and kitty loves it  it never stinks and it can be scooped  it basically pulls all moisture out of the litter box and prevents anything from smelling  i can use the same litter with 1 cat for nearly a month before it starts to look ragged    even then  it is still usable  do yourself a favor and give this other litter a try first    it will save you money and eliminate the smell   no joke    34 ultra pet ultra micro crystals cat litter  34   
product	my cat loves these and i love getting them for her  however  you can purchase the 2 5 ounce package for around 2 dollars  knowing this is 5 5 ounces and costs quadruple  i will never purchase at this price  you are getting priced gouged for sure 
product	i was paying  9 98 per package for 18 drummies because winco had them for   3 97 per package of 9  so i did not think that was to bad a price since shipping was free with prime but   the order i received today i paid a dollar more per package and received onlly 9 per package that means that i paid 2 dollars more for 1 2 the amount from the last order  something does not seem right to me mjb
quality	`my 6 year old lab will not eat it  it is just too hard and flavorless for her to munch on  kinda feels that it is just not worth the effort 
health	needed to get an allergy free food for my 2 dogs  this is good solid and does not upset my 2 teacup puppies w allergies
health	both of my cats sniffed it and turned away  i bought this because of my cat suffering a urinary tract problem and after reading reviews thought it may be a good product for him    unhappily half of these cans are still sitting in my cupboard and the ones i opened went to complete waste  they wanted nothing to do with it at all 
product	this product arrived in a completely flat package  which i thought was really cool  as for the toy itself  it is not too bad  there is a level 1  which is the toy without the cardboard fold up inside  and level 2  with the fold up  level 1 was too easy for my cat  he likes to hunt outside   but level 2 he seems to enjoy  i only put one or two treats in a time because he gets them out fairly quickly <br  ><br  >there s also a   34 secret  34  level 3  but you did not hear it from me 
product	this lasted less than 10 minutes with my dog and he had a hole in it  this toy is for light chewers only  i would say the size is medium  not large like it is listed  i would say if your dog is over 35 to 40 pounds  i would not buy it 
product	i’ve been looking and trying dog toys – in particular food dispensers – for my lhasa apso as a way to challenge and make him more active while indoors  i tried this treat ball dog toy but was disappointed with it  the round shape makes it monotonous and not challenging for my dog  alternatively  i got a toy in mushroom shape which allows for more leverage to push and eject the food more easily  i found that the magic mushroom toy was the best since it improved my dog s meal time greatly in many ways  i made a video to demonstrate exactly that  also how to use it  etc here s the link  
health	i had very high hopes for these dog treats  especially considering the price  they do not have any bad ingredients and they are made in america  my dog has a lot of allergies and has a very sensitive stomach  usually all sweet potato treats are fine for him  first of all there are like all of 10 chews in the bag  and unfortunately they gave my dog diarrhea  i will not be purchasing these treats again 
health	i love kong products but this one just did not cut it  it is a hard plastic  not the usual kong rubber  my dog destroys all toys except kong until this one  she chewed it until it was dangerous and i had to take it away  even when she tried to play and get the treat the plastic was so hard that it was not good as it crashed to the floor with a bang  she never did get the treat out of it 
quality	my dogs will not eat these   boy   they are repugnant w  smoke odor  not for us  will return w  the other brand product i had purchased purchased   cede
quality	my dogs do not like these treats  left them out thinking that they wold eventually eat them  but oe dog buried his under the rug  cede
health	these are no good for my cats  they often throw up after eating them  maybe its the flavor or the taste  no recommendation 
product	we like the breeze system  but their pricing is way over the top  way to expensive  breeze makes a good product and we will continue to use it 
quality	i ordered after reading reviews i ordered to treat my 11 12 lb minpin  i was waiting for the fleas to   34 start falling off dead  34  nothing  after 2 treatments  he still has fleas  i do not like to leave negative feedback but seller should not over hype this product and make claims that seem like a miracle cure  i am returning the rest of the capsules
product	item are not really   34 liver treats   34  they are more like mini cookies  flavored  apparently  i did not try one   with liver  but not in a sufficient quantity to even smell like liver   liver has a distinct odor   you know if when you smell it   these have no noticeable odor  <br  ><br  >my dog rejected them  she loves liver  and they are definitely not reward worthy 
quality	dogs did not like  we have heard great things about this but both of our dogs could care less  possibly a bad batch  we will give it a try one more time from somewhere else
product	i did not really tell a difference in my dogs coat or shedding  i probably will not be purchasing this again unfortunately 
product	amazon  i buy a lot of stuff on your site  kindly tell me how in the heck i am supposed to notify you that this package never arrived  i have searched   and searched   and searched  and you ve added a lot of frustration to my day  next time perhaps i should go to the local pet store and buy this product to avoid this <br  >hopefully someone there will actually look at this review and get my product to me 
product	the contents of the cans had separated so that my cat licked the liquid and then left the solids uneaten in his dish  it was disappointing 
product	amazon  i buy a lot of stuff on your site  kindly tell me how in the heck i am supposed to notify you that this package never arrived  i have searched   and searched   and searched  and you ve added a lot of frustration to my day  next time perhaps i should go to the local pet store and buy this product to avoid this <br  >hopefully someone there will actually look at this review and get my product to me 
health	this product has stay fresh packets that are made of iron  this is very dangerous for a dog  poison control considers iron  confirmed by placing a magnet next to the substance in the packet  poison  the dogswell website said this about the packets in case of ingestion      34 you might notice that your pet is thirstier than normal this is ok  as your pet just had a salty treat  although this “treat” is not as tasty as the meatier ones in the package   34 <br  ><br  >that explanation provided to the general public by this company could not be more false  my dog had eaten the packet along with a few treats and was indeed very very sick  the vet was not sure she would make it  when i contacted the company  which took a few times to get them to even respond to me  they said they did not even know what was on their website regarding the packets  i tried very patiently to work with them  i got them to delete the portion of the verbiage  i asked them to switch to another packet which will be much less harmful if pets get into it  but that will not happen  there are many other options out there to keep a product fresh but yet are safer for use  i believe pets deserve better  please be careful when selecting treat options for your pets 
product	this is a very expensive chew treat  i feed premium food so i do not expect my dogs to get their nutrition from a treat chew  what i do expect is that it will keep them busy for a decent amount of time <br  ><br  >this bar did keep my dog busy   but mostly because he did not really like it  he is a weimaraner puppy with a mouth like a gator and teeth like a shark and the chew is about 1 4 gone  he will chew on it when he stumbles across it but he will not actively look for it as he does for bully sticks <br  ><br  >he s had it for over a week but i will wait and see if he gets any more fond of it before i decide to buy again 
quality	i work at an animal shelter and we get this type of product often as a donation because their cat will not eat it  they just lick the gravy and leave the weird meat pieces behind  i bought this fancy feast by mistake  i usually get the   34 classic  34   it is sometimes hard to see which is which on the amazon website so choose carefully if your cat will not eat strange meat pieces in gravy 
health	as many reviewers have indicated  this product solved loose stool problems in many cats  but it did not for my cat  after going through the entire box in about a month  there was no change in the litter box  i ended up going to the vet and they sold me another probiotic from rx vitamins called rx biotic  also sold on amazon  and positive results were   34 rendered  34  after the very first treatment  the quantity purchased from the vet was greater than the quantity in this fortiflora package  and the price of the rx biotic from the vet was competitive with this product  rx biotic has been a regular  no pun intended  part of my 12 year old cats diet for a couple weeks and has vastly improved her loose stool problems 
quality	this was not the quality of big  long  thick bone i have purchased for my dog in the past that kept him occupied for weeks  this one has only a fold or two of rawhide and blaze tore though it in a day and about the same price as the much better quality bones i have bought in the past 
quality	bought these in the past from a local pet store but they were expensive so i ordered a large quantity from amazon  they came loose in a plastic bag and the color was different and they looked old and stale  my dog used to love these but she would not even touch them after she smelled it  what a waste of money 
health	i was surprised and perhaps it is specific to my dog but every time he eats one of these he is wheezing and throwing up  i thought maybe it was getting stuck in his throat because they are small and i was throwing them to him  but i would also put one on the ground and get the same effect  in addition to that  they smell profoundly disgusting and even my dog would occasionally smell one and not want it  says a lot about your product if a dog will not eat it        
quality	what a rec d  was all dried out  crumbled and the cats would not eat it or their pills  this is not typical for the product  so i am not sure if it is getting temperature abuse or what in amazon warehouses  in order to return  i was told that i would need to pay return ups shipping    more than the value of the product  what a waste of my time  if they cannot do a simple refund on low dollar items like this  then i cannot be their customer for this type of product 
product	more than half of the product arrived crushed into very small pieces   too small to use even as small training treats for the dog  will not   cannot afford to order anymore 
product	i bought these for my dogs  monthly flea and heart worm pills  i have malteses so the pills are not large  the   34 pill pocket  34  cracks every time i stuff it with their medicine and i have to fight it to not fall out  finally once i have managed to get it to my dogs mouth they are able to just eat the pocket and spit out the pill  i only even gave it 2 stars because my dogs like the taste  worthless for their intended purpose  they just ended up being overpriced treats 
product	amazon advertises this dog toy as being made in us  it is not  i was very disappointed to see the   34 made in china  34  phrase on the packaging 
product	there was two or three nice size ones in the pkg but the rest of them were so small and thin  they were supposed to be 12\\  long  very disappointed  will not order again 
quality	they lick up the gravy  but leave most of the chunks for me to throw away and clean the dish  it is hard to find one they really like and will eat after serving more then twice 
product	fast shipping and the product description is accurate  my problem with it is it bounces on my leg and swings as we walk  i hook it to my belt look   during our first walk the pouch ended up flipping around so that the treats fell out behind me  hooking to some belt loops is better than others but i personally find it very annoying and will be replacing  unfortunately  because i think this is one of the best looking pouches i have seen 
product	my dog broke two of the knobs off the first time we used it  they are only glued on  very disappointing 
quality	i blew  50 on 3 bags of these  they are hard and even sound like plastic poker chips  that is the best way to describe these  my dogs will not touch them  false advertising  i do not recommend these at all  do not waste your money 
health	i only bought these because when i typed in diabetic dog treats and saw how healthy they were   i ordered them <br  >when i read the contents all that was listed was protein  fiber and crude fat  only unitl i went to the bet with my diabetic dog and found out his blood sugar level was 715 did i do some investigating and found out that these treats have molasses and potatoes in them which are high in sugar  these should not be listed with the diabetic dog treats and am very upset that i bought these  i almost or should i say you almost   killed my dog <br  >i will not be ordering these again 
health	has improved the number of hairballs my cat has  all of my pets eat it with no problem although to me it smells bad  one of my dogs does not seem to digest it well  i see white and light yellow blobs in his stool
product	the last few times i have ordered special diet cans from amazon they have arrived dented  its not really a big deal  but they do not stack nice in my cabinet which gets annoying since they are always falling over  we feed our one cat the special diet because he has had a few bouts with crystals over the years  he started out on dry food and the vet recommended friskies special diet which surprised me  he normally is totally against any brand you can buy in a supermarket  he said it was pretty similar to the science diet formula and much more budget friendly  he said he would rather see me feeding any brand wet food  over dry food  even if the dry food was a premium brand 
quality	this is a very dry pate style canned cat food that has no gravy and no juice  it has a strong fishy odor  when you take it out of the can it looks like a big clump of dry cooked cereal  maybe because it has rice  barley and oatmeal in it  a web site recommended this food as being extremely healthy for cats  when i gave this to my cat he tasted it for a few seconds and then he walked away  i offered it to him on several other days  but he will not eat this  however  taste is a personal thing  i am sure some cats would love this food 
health	but with all the articles about products from china causing health issues in have not ordered anymore  the bag i received was definitely made in china  i am having a hard time finding a product for this price nth at my dogs like which are made in usa  my dogs enjoyed the treats didn t ever throw them up or display any health issues but just to be on the safe side i am no longer buying this product 
health	i received sensitive stomach not sensitive stomach and skin  i ordered sensitive stomach and skin and would like the correct cat food shipped asap 
health	i do not want to give this a bad review  because people really need to start taking care of their cats  kidney disease is a top cause of death in house cats  and we need to start feeding them better <br  ><br  >that said  sadly mine does not really like this  i still buy it and leave it out  and he eats it sometimes but of course he prefers the food that is bad for him   note  i do not feed him bad food but my mother does because she says he will   34 starve  34  as he hates the healthy foods <br  ><br  >so  your cat might not love it  but still   just try   its good for him  mine eats it somtimes  better than never 
health	i received too many dented cans  i had to throw 5 7 cans away  i believe this it what made my cat sick 
quality	this time it is classic which means it is sort of ground just like pate      kittens adore it  adult cats will eat it if they<br  >are hungry  but they keep waiting for the main course which is in small chunks and a lot of gravy    fancy feast<br  >classic is one of the best pate s but some of the older cats will not go near it   <br  ><br  >renee evers
quality	we just received this toy for our 14 pound rescue dog and was disappointed  it is a very hard plastic toy that our dog cannot pick up  we put small treats in it and they fell out  if this toy had something for our dog to   34 hang on  34  to it would have been a better toy  too hard and not fun to play with  it needs to be softer 
product	you get one 6 3 pound bag  this is not a pack of 5  it is a total rip off  do not waste your money on this  you can buy the same thing for  7 at a grocery store 
product	we were really counting on the 2 day prime shipping that we paid for but were disappointed  we ordered it so that it would get here before we ran out of dog food and it did not get here in time  our small town does not carry this brand anywhere so we have to go out of town to buy it 
product	one would believe that a product labeled with the akc  american kennel club  printed all over it would be an american made product  guess again folks  small print on the back of the package    34 made in china  34   i would guess they are safe as they have been treated by irradiation <br  >now the review of the product  our golden mix really enjoyed them  every time we went near the cabinet where we kept them she would do her   34 i want my treat dance   34  we limited her to one a day  which brings us to a minor complaint  package contains 25 pieces  why not 30 for a whole months supply  i guess i will never understand the minds in marketing  what geniuses <br  >come on pet brands  inc   get with the program  package 30 to a pack  not 25 
quality	i gave them away to a friend of mine who does rescue  my dogs did not like it enough to even try it  they did not like the smell 
health	my westie loves to swallow things  he liked the product fine and it chewed it down  but probably not enough  he was breathing abnormally afterwards  with his heart thumping for a while  only then did i see the writing in the back that it would be hazardous if not properly chewed  i gave rest of the bag away 
product	ok  i like annies  products in general <br  >  anything  moving us away from gmo products is a good thing  as martha would say  <br  ><br  >but i have to rate this one for pets with only 2 stars <br  ><br  >the picture implies a larger box than it is  it is actually<br  >only 8 5 ounces of treats  and the box actually came<br  >opened <br  ><br  >it appears that is how this is meant to be packaged    opened on the top <br  ><br  >it was not even fastened together as it is shown in the product ad    which<br  >i would guess is a way to jam more of these boxes into one<br  >larger shipping container <br  ><br  >this means  quite literally  that some of the product can<br  >drop out  or be pilfered out  from what is shipped to us<br  >when buying from this product page <br  ><br  >there are several types of treats in the box <br  >our dog did eat some of the treats  but did not take some of<br  >the others  the log shaped ones  readily <br  ><br  >overall  based on the packaging and the weight to price ratio <br  >this one will not be bought again <br  ><br  >thanks
quality	not a favorite  little yorkie did not care for these  tried to use as a treat  but she did not think they were a great treat  tried to use as an enticement on her regular food  but she was not enticed  as a meal replacement     she preferred not to eat and wait for something else  will not purchase these again for my finicky little one 
quality	i now have 23 cans of food that none of my 3 cats will touch  i also ordered the dry food for one of my cats who eats nothing but dry who is not usually finicky  but she will not even touch this stuff  so  i put it outside for the stray cats that come around at night and they will not even eat it    that is pretty bad  i do not know what i am going to do with all this food except maybe feed it to the possums  if they will even eat it   
quality	trying to find a chew bone that will last longer than 13 minutes  this has lasted  but only because my dog will not touch it  expensive for a door stop 
product	perfect for the single cat owner  but too many plastic cups to be recycled  i hope they are recyclable  each cup is 1 2 can  more expensive than buying from the grocery store 
health	i really should have known better since the small size in the same brand made my yorkies sick to their stomachs  especially one of them  i had to switch brands 
quality	i love the fact that product is natural and price per ounce is great  my dogs are a chihuahua and pomeranian and neither could chew them too big   i broke them up and even soaked crumbs in water and they still would not eat them  just thought i would pass it along  i know different things work for different dogs  just to let you know  i tried another product which is smaller and my dogs ate those but i did not notice a difference in their behavior  so the search continues  
quality	my parrots will throw them out of their dishes  they do not care for them at all  will not purchase again 
health	this product along with the other greenies vet formula made my 12 lb norwich terrier gain weight  she gained almost 1 pound after a month of eating 1 greenie a day  we had weaned her off bully sticks after my vet said they were too hard on her teeth  we purchased the greenies vet formula thinking it would help but she still could not shed the weight so we stopped using both products <br  ><br  >if your dog has issues with gaining weight from eating carbs  stay away from the greenies and go another route to clean her teeth <br  ><br  >background on my dog <br  >my terrier is 6 years old and does not do well with carbs  her weight issues started at 5 years old when she was spayed  the slowdown in her metabolism after the surgery made her immediately gain 1 2 lbs  we put her on weight management kibble but it did not work so we switched her to raw chicken patties  nature s variety   she immediately lost weight on the raw diet so we have kept her on it for 1 year  we realized that whenever we change her diet and try to slowly work kibble into it  she immediately gains weight so we have steered clear of carbs  i am not suggesting you do the same  just describing my experience with my dog and what has worked for me 
product	the treats were all crumbled in the bag for both sizes small and large   very disappointed  i like prime bc i can order easily and it just shows up but if they are crumbled  it defeats the purpose  boo 
quality	puppy refuses to eat it  we tried and tried feeding her it but she does not like the flavor of it but would eat other brands 
health	but it gave them digestive issues  they can usually eat just about any wet cat food without problems  but i think the cheese in this recipe gave them problems 
product	ok deal  the meat has been processed so i was a bit disappointed  i would not order this again  but the dogs are happy with the product 
product	i always buy nyla chew toys for my dogs love the way that they last   they usually get nasty looking before they wear out  but this one i did not really care for it just got to sticky and left crumbs all over  my dog did not even eat it just chewed it to bits  i usually do not buy the edible  bad choice on my part 
product	i bought two    one for my 6 year old dog and one for my 4 month old puppy   and well they do not really use it  the toy is extremely small 
quality	my dog did not care about this toy at all  i was hoping it would be something fun for him but he just was not interested 
health	these were small and a choking hazard for my golden  not very helpful  i threw them away  i would recommend for small dogs though  not for goldens though
health	i will do more research before buying this brand again  when i feed him the recommended number of scoops for his size based on the label  he puts on weight  when i reduce the number of scoops  he is hungry all the time  i have read good things about royal canin  but i might get the weight loss formula next time 
quality	at first my dogs would not eat it alone  i now mix it with hi tek naturals dry kibble which they love and is a premium dog food  also  the prices are a little less on amazon  i will not purchase this flavor again  i would like to find a canned food that they will eat alone 
product	i really loved the print but the packaging was not appropriate for ceramic items  this was in many  many pieces before i could even open the package  there was one small piece of bubble wrap that did nothing to protect the item  i have requested a replacement  so let us hope they do a better job of packaging the item this time 
quality	i opened this package and counted the ears inside  and counted again  and a third time  there were only 5 pieces  and one of those pieces was half an ear  the ears came soaked in grease  it had even collected at the bottom of the bag  my dog loves ears  especially lambs ears  and he will not go near these  trash time 
health	this product includes a high percentage  maybe 30    my guess  of obvious scraps from human grade liver  there are a lot of connective tissues  large blood vessels and fat included with the product  but  stewart does not have as much of this objectionable material as other freeze dried liver products i have tried  in my opinion <br  >my fussy dog seems to like freeze dried liver more than other kinds of liver i have tried with him so i still do buy it  i have given him raw liver  won t touch it  and cooked liver  will eat it first day or two then is disinterested   i have given him dehydrated liver and he will eat it if it is not too dry  however  i do not like the process of dehydrating liver as it smells bad and is messy to handle  as well you have to freeze it if you want to keep it for longer than a day or two  when it still needs to be at least refrigerated   when i feed the freeze dried product to my dog i cut off chunks of fat  blood vessels and connective tissue  it may not be unhealthy for him to eat this material but i find it disgusting  so in the garbage it goes 
product	we were disappointed that the biscuits arrived in really bad condition  we needed biscuits for our dogs so we just gave them the broken pieces  thankfully the local store has started stocking extra large biscuits again  so we will buy local from now on 
health	i was excited to get my order as i wanted to give my dogs something to do during a bad storm we were expected to have  i was able to give my rhodesian ridgeback and pit bull only 6 out of the entire package  the rest are so thin  like a pencil   that i am actually concerned they are too thin and may cause a choking hazard  i feel a bit cheated and i guess i will have to give the rest of the bag to some friend who has a really small breed dog  i will not buy again    find another supplier if you can 
health	both tablet   capsule allergy pill pockets are awful  they are really sticky and fall apart  rarely able to keep pills  etc  in them  super disappointed 
product	i am a little disappointed with this product  because all amazon had available was the med lg size  i actually had to cut each pellet several times for my conures  some tried it some didn t  i would love to see an appropriate size available for the smaller guys 
product	now  i love cadet s 2 5 lb bag of duck jerky  it is very high quality and my yorkie likes em  so  i decided to try cadet s chicken rawhide sticks <br  ><br  >but   these rawhide wrapped chicken sticks are cheap  the chicken is very thin   sparse    the little bit of chicken  seemingly almost melting into the rawhide <br  ><br  >so  my dog desperately diligently scrapes the super thin chicken off of each stick  not ever really getting enough of the good stuff   bummer <br  ><br  >a disappointing purchase  i will not buy this particular product  again 
product	very pissed off at company and amazon for false advertising  i looked at the bag at home and see it says both california company and then product of china     which is it and shame on amazon for letting them falslely advertise to us <br  >i would never have purchased knowing made in china       
product	i should have returned it but i figured i would give it time     i see no difference with the fleas  after purchasing this to try to save money  i still had to purchase the more expensive 6 pk which does work 
product	i agree with one of the other reviews  the small pocket inside is useless and annoying  very hard to use during training  this pouch takes two hands to open  hard to get your hand in to reach treats with the inside pouch getting in the way <br  >great idea to have the bag pouch on the outside but the design does not allow you to grab treats one handed 
product	my dogs love these  and they were cheap  but there is so much dye in these that their poop comes out red and freaked me out thinking they were bleeding internally  i cannot imagine that this is good for them  will not buy again 
product	this worked great at killing fleas but changed the color of my salt and pepper to a dull brown  i called bayer and they said that was a side effect for this product and refunded my money  would not use it again 
quality	my crimson bellied conure does not seem to be a big fan of this diet  i would say it is close to 50  pellets and he refuses to eat them  he would pick through and only eat the seeds and dried fruit bits and then leave the pellets  so  i essentially ended up throwing away half of the bag of food 
product	this says  6 oz pack of 6  but i only received 1  6 oz bag  this is wrong  i want my money back or my six bags  what i paid for   very disappointed 
quality	my cat loves the salmon treats that came in the old packaging  boxed   there were softer treats  these new ones in the re sealable bag are different and my cat will not eat them  they seem much harder and look different  i hope you still sell the other kind 
product	i like the starmark everlasting treats   even though they only last maybe 2 hours in my persistent dog s jaws  i wish i could find them for a lower price than the relatively common  7 each  so i was a little confused when i saw this seller listing a quantity of 1 for  20 97  down from  60   that was just crazy right   unless it was a case price  and to further my confusion the shipping weight was listed at 2 5 lbs  now i know these things are marked at 7oz each   so i figured this must be a case price with maybe 4   7oz packages inside  there was nothing to disuade this belief   no reviews  no answered questions   zip  zilch  nada <br  >so let me be the first   i took a chance  and it was an epic fail  i spent  20 97 and received 1  count  em   1  7oz treat package  with the shipping weight on my received package at 1 pound  not 2 5   i was quite a bit miffed to pay 3 4 times the going rate for this little item let me tell you  so buyer beware  if it looks too good to be true it most likely is <br  > on the plus side  after expressing my shock  indignation and disappointment to the seller they advised they are giving me a full refund   and i get to keep the treat  which makes me feel a little guilty   but i would have gladly shipped it back at my cost  after all it is 1 pound  shipping is hardly anything for that 
product	my dog absolutely loves the green teeth  breath chews on the market  and these are no exception  however  she also loves the less expensive but otherwise comparable brand as well 
product	now  i love cadet s 2 5 lb bag of duck jerky  it is very high quality and my yorkie likes em  so  i decided to try cadet s chicken rawhide sticks <br  ><br  >but   these rawhide wrapped chicken sticks are cheap  the chicken is very thin   sparse    the little bit of chicken  seemingly almost melting into the rawhide <br  ><br  >so  my dog desperately diligently scrapes the super thin chicken off of each stick  not ever really getting enough of the good stuff   bummer <br  ><br  >a disappointing purchase  i will not buy this particular product  again 
product	i bought these for my cat right after i adopted him  he initially liked them but as with most cats he decided to change his mind  quick delivery and good price  i would have given 5 if the cat liked them 
quality	i tried feeding them these to my cats without pills and they would not touch them  i tried smaller pieces and they would not touch those other  i am sure other people must have some success with this product but for me they were a total waste of money 
quality	our doxie loves food   it is the highlight of his day    we decided to give this a try because he is overweight  despite not being fed more than he requires   this claims to help them maintain a healthy weight   i also liked that it has no fillers and is a natural dog food   unfortunately  our dog does not like it  he ate it the first 2 days  then gave us the doxie look of disappointment on the 3rd day   we tried mixing in a small spoon full of canned food  which did not interest him  and then tried adding warm water   he would eat a very  very small amount and then walk away looking so sad  as i said  he loves his food <br  ><br  >after a week of this  thinking he would eventually start eating it if he got hungry enough  he still would not eat it  so we gave up on this brand   we have switched him to a raw foods diet  which he loves <br  ><br  >the one plus   he did loose a bit of weight from not eating  i guess in that way  the dog food lives up to it is weight maintenance claims  o 
product	i do not know why i even bothering to rate this item  it is not worth a single star  the product came to me in powder form  i had to send it back for a refund 
health	before i bought this product i read reviews on it because one of my two dogs has bad teeth and i did not want to pay for something that would not at least take care of her breath  most of the bad reviews i saw complained about how the company had false advertising on the box and usually sent you an incorrect number of dental chews  while the good reviews all raved about how this product was fantastic and made their dogs teeth look like puppy teeth again  i bought these because my dog was getting up in age and i had just taken her to the vet because i thought she had periodontal disease  for those of you that have a dog around the age of five and they have bad teeth  i suggest you look it up because i had no idea what it was either until i examined my dogs mouth one night and saw her mouth looked horrible  anyway  i had just taken my dog to the vet where she had her teeth cleaned  a pricy bill i might add  and even though i was brushing her teeth a few weeks a night i wanted something that might be a bit easier for both of us to handle so i started doing research on dental chews that i had not tried in the past  i came upon these and people that got the correct box count had nothing but nice things to say so i thought why not right  if you have more than one dog like i do then you are your probably going to try the biggest box count so it is a little more economical  here is my complaint on why i dislike these so much  if the box of greenies are not gone in a month the chews become hard like hard enough that your dog wont be able to chew on them and it could end up breaking their teeth  and they are not easily digestible  every single time my dog that had to go to the vet had one she would throw it back up within 24 hours  i know it was the chews too because i would give them to her for a couple days and then i would stop and she would be fine  but every time she got one she would get sick and my dog is not weak stomached she can eat anything and she will be totally fine except when it comes to these chews  i am not suggesting you do not buy these but i am hear to tell you my experience and mine was a negative one  my dogs did not even finish the first box we bought 
health	this food consistently makes my kitties sick  my vet detests this food and recommended we stop feeding it immediately  normally  i would be all about   34 science  34  but not in this sense  cats are carnivores  this stuff is trash  feed your kitty something that more closely resembles their natural diet  that is not trash sprayed with fat slurry 
quality	the plastic material is not appealing for my gsd and pitbull<br  ><br  >it just rolls under the couch <br  ><br  >maybe my dogs are dumb but they do not care for the treat inside but the ball is difficult to handle
product	the canned food came with a brown box  its original packaging was missing   the cans were all loosely packaged with one unit missing  and all of them are dented  it leads me to think that there is something shady about this producer  i contacted amazon to get a refund but it says that this product is not eligible for a refund  this is completely unacceptable <br  ><br  >don t fall into this trap 
health	i like the kibble size  it is the only kibble i have found that my cat will chew instead of swallowing whole and vomiting it back up on my carpet  i do not like the ingredient list <br  ><br  >chicken by product meal  brown rice  chicken fat  corn  corn gluten meal  wheat gluten  natural flavors  pea fiber  brewers rice  rice hulls  dried plain beet pulp<br  ><br  >those are the first few ingredients  makes me sad that a company as well known as royal canin cannot put better quality ingredients in their food 
health	got these before and they were fine  this batch is rock hard  have an 8 month old puppy  and he was choking on them  stuck with a six pack now  will not order again 
quality	my husky did do not even touch this bone  he looked at it like it something strange in it  and to throw in the garbage 
quality	none of my three liked these at all  they smell pretty bad  i have a ferret who will try to eat anything and he would not eat these    
product	when i opened the package  the little green bones were half white   dry and discolored   my little king charles spaniels love this product  usually  was the product just old or exposed to high temps  i do not know but i will not order it again  i will stick to buying fresher product from store  locally 
quality	have purchased these treats many times but not thru this supplier  treats were stale and dried out and dogs will not eat them 
quality	the peanuts are still in the shell and the shells had visible mold on them  not risking feeding them to my cockatoo  there was weird crusty stuff on the almonds  and some of the safflower seeds are dyed a bright blue  i do not feel it is necessary to expose my bird to artificial dyes on seeds she is guaranteed to eat  seems to be a cheap blend of low quality products  amazon was amazing at handling our return as always  they should remove this product  it does not match their company quality standards 
quality	look at the label  main ingredient chicken by product fillers  feed your dog good quality food  look at canidae  coats look better  no skin problems  more energy  better food  if you do not like canidae look for other better quality that you are comfortable with  do your research and get better food for you best friend 
product	smelled like dog treats  had black skid marks on it and a few little nicks in the plastic  i still love the brand and buy it for all of my pups any time they need a new toy  not worth it to send it back for a replacement  just worth noting  this is very usual for the brand in my experience  though i usually get them directly from their website and will go back to doing that after this experience 
quality	unusable  dented horribly  every can     would not even feed it to the poor freezing outside beggar cats  2 thumbs down      
product	the thickness is too big to fit into the tunnels that run through the ends of our kong bone   as they are marketed to do  even if split along their length   so they were a waste of money 
product	i formerly liked the zuke s brand very much  but thanks to a previous review stating how they sold out to nestl eacute  purina  and after double checking it was true online  i am no longer a fan  apparently this happened in january of this year  so it is not like we have already tested out the treats made after the merger and know they are ok  who knows if and when  most likely just when  they will start changing the formula and source of ingredients  and i doubt they will even make any changes obvious  i am very disappointed in zuke s  and do not plan to ever support them again  what a shame they felt the need to mess with a good thing 
quality	delivery was on time  since i do not eat it  i cannot fairly judge it  but my dog ziggy does not seem to like this batch as well as previous batches  it might be under baked just a little  anyway  he gives it three wags 
product	when it arrived the pail it comes in was broken and it was falling out into the box  i figured i would just use it any ways  i live in a very small house and have never had any problems with smell of our cat  right after i stared using this the smell got so bad i had to buy new litter again  i would not buy it again or recommend any one else does  i have never had cat litter so bad so bad in my life and i have had cats since i can remember 
quality	have used the freeze dried beef liver in the neat little squares   tub sized order   for years beef liver gets 5 stars <br  ><br  >problem  i ordered the chicken liver flavor for my new puppy and discovered it is not in the squares but in small irregular pieces  about half of them crumbled into a fine powder en route and are unusable to me  i will not buy them again in that flavor nor will i buy the tub size  i will try a small bag and see if it arrives in better condition <br  ><br  >disappointing
product	this elk antler was beyond disappointing  it shattered and flaked and had to be thrown away  in pieces  within the hour  extremely disappointing since an elk antler usually lasts my dog about 3 months so i can justify the price  staying away from this brand 
quality	the seller was amazon  i paid about 8 bucks  i got the small size  i have a small dog  chihuahua   he weighs about 8 pounds <br  ><br  >i also purchased a   asin b003aruku0 smarter toys iq treat ball dog toy  small  3 inches    at the same time  i was hoping to keep both the twist  n treat and the iq ball  so my dog would have some variety in toys  however  i tried to return the twist  n treat  since i did not like it   amazon returns are very easy and fair  i selected   34 no longer wanted  34  as the reason  and the next message i saw was   34 keep this item and receive a refund  it is on us  as a valued customer  you do not need to return this item to get a refund   34  thanks amazon  so  i will donate it to my local animal shelter humane society instead <br  ><br  >for treats  i use   asin b000h0zjhw zuke s mini naturals dog treats roasted chicken recipe  16 ounce    they are small  and i figured they would be perfect for the twist  n treat  my dogs regular food is about the same size as zuke s <br  ><br  >i read many reviews about the twist  n treat before buying it  i had a good idea of what i was buying  the video review that customer   34 ~ just me  ~  34  posted on 3 23 2010 was also helpful  even though she does not tell us what size twist  n treat she bought <br  ><br  >does my dog like it <br  ><br  >yes  my dog likes the twist  n treat  why  because it dispenses treats so easily <br  ><br  >what i did not know   <br  ><br  >the twist  n treat has openings on both sides  the openings are the same size  and they are directly opposite each other  so  treats fall out quickly <br  ><br  >but do not they say you can screw down the twist  n treat to lessen the number of treats it dispenses  yes  you can  however    the 2 openings on each side are semi circles  one set of semi circles on the bottom of the twist  n treat  and another set of semi circles on the top of the twist  n treat   when closing the twist  n treat  you screw the top part into the bottom part  then   <br  > 1<br  >if the semi circles on each side do not line up to form a circle  then no treats will be dispensed  unless i unscrew it a lot  and then treats fall out very easily all around the twist  n treat  because the gap all around the twist  n treat is too large  <br  > 2<br  >if i screw the twist  n treat all the way down and line up the semi circles  then the treats will not dispense  because the opening is not large enough <br  > 3<br  >if i unscrew the twist  n treat half a turn with the semi circles still lined up  then the treats will dispense  however  now they fall out too easily quickly from the 2 openings  my dog was able to get all the treats out in about 1 minute   at this point  i tried to screw the twist  n treat just a little bit to the right in order to lessen the opening size  so the semi circles were not lined up exactly   but i could not   34 get it just right  34   and i really do not want to have to   34 get it just

product	i decided to try these since our dogs love real peanut butter  however  these have a huge tendency to crumble apart so it is very difficult to use if you have to give a couple of pills   anything that does not easily fit in them as the come in the package will be challenging  this is not the case with the beef  hickory  and chicken flavors
health	i only fed these to my yorkie 4 5 times  one a day  i actually threw the rest away  my dog threw them up  still not digested  not a good product for a small dog  it is too expensive to use and have a sick dog and throw the rest away 
health	our dog got sick from this product  do not buy these treats are from china  our little dog has renal failure 
product	i have 4 labs and decided to try these  but with only 3 in the box these can get very expensive when you have more then one dog
health	enough said  made in china and pricey  did not make my dogs sick tho  thankfully  but it is not worth the risk getting them again and the price is not great 
product	shortly after applying this  my dog got fleas  according to the vet  in south florida  at least  fleas have built an immunity to frontline  get comfortis from your vet  it is more expensive  but it is an oral medication and it kills the fleas in 30 minutes  after switching  my dog was flea free  do not waste your money 
health	it worked nicely but as soon as i stopped treating his ears  that nasty oder and infection came back  poor boy he is old and they are getting harder to treat 
quality	do not know why  but buffy would not eat this particular flavor of food  so that is not really my take on it  but my cat s  and you know how finicky they can be   
health	it seems to be working as a hairball remedy but  at least with our cat  she prefers wet food and will only eat this after all wet food is gone 
health	does not exactly do the trick  gonna try again before infestation begins  i am gonna give it another try  hopefully works 
quality	horrible artificial smell  ferrets would not touch it  have to keep writing to publish this review     sometimes you do not need to say so much 
product	not really  still contains grains  not the worst product  but there are much better options  ferrets liked it but we switched to dr  foster   smith brand for better nutrition 
quality	i have a picky mutt and he will not eat these no matter what  i like the size for training so if your dog likes  em  they are probably good to keep in your pocket 
quality	this was the first time that i tried this flavor and my dog did not care for it  she would lick at it  but never took to it  will stick with the chicken flavor which she really enjoys 
health	2 14   he threw up a hairball  very disappointing  but it is still early days <br  ><br  >3 2   he threw up another hairball  still early days  will wait at least a few months <br  ><br  >3 15   he threw up another hairball  averaging one hairball every two weeks <br  ><br  >this is day one of a review that i plan to continue to update periodically to see if this product really will alleviate my cat s hairballs  or at least drastically reduce them  if you have cats who have hairballs  you know firsthand how heart wrenching and upsetting it is to watch them meow in pain and then vomit their little guts out  if you ve ever thrown up yourself  you know what an unpleasant experience it is  i can only imagine how much that is magnified by throwing up a huge chunk of hair  i have tried several brands of hairball formula food  including some of the top ranked foods  like iams and royal canin  that started out great  then stopped working for some reason  <br  ><br  >i really feel for what my furry friend goes through  he got so backed up from hairballs that i had to take him to the vet  he was constipated from the hairballs and needed an enema to get his little system working again   500 later  i asked the vet  this alleged expert in feline care  what i should do to help my cat to stop having hairballs and her response was  i kid you not  i have a witness    \\ get him to lick himself less \\  if that is the kind of help that is being offered by professionals  then what are we supposed to do   <br  ><br  >i have tried the petromalt or whatever it is called  but my cat hates it so much that it stresses him out too much to give it to him  and also he just rubs it on the furniture instead of licking it off his paw like the instructions say he is supposed to do  i guess he is smarter than the average cat  anyway  that is part of the problem  cats are extremely intelligent and sensitive creatures  you cannot fool them <br  ><br  >next i tried iambs  which did not work  next i tried royal canin  which worked for awhile  then mysteriously stopped working  i do not know why  next i tried to change his diet to a raw  grain free diet and he actually vomited more on that diet  so i had to stop that <br  ><br  >now here we are  trying the next best wonder cure which is supposed to be science diet  i truly hope it is as wonderful as i have heard  it certainly is expensive  but where my cat is concerned  his health and his happiness  i am not one to complain  i will be only too happy to be able to report that this food has stopped drastically reduced his hairballs <br  ><br  >today when the package arrived  my cat knew it was for him  it was so adorable  he came right to the front door when i greeted the deliveryman  my cat sniffed the box the moment i set it down  it is so cute how smart they are  i opened the box immediately and gave him a few pieces to try  he ate them in a frenzy  so i got him a dish and set it down  he started eating the science diet food right away with absolute relish  taste is evidently no problem  i left out his old food  as well  so he could have a choice  later when he got hungry again  he went right to the science diet food  so day one i consider a success  of course  i cannot yet speak to the hairball situation until he has been on the diet for awhile  btw  the only other thing he gets is water and kitty treats  i wonder if the kitty treats could cause hairballs  does anyone know <br  ><br  >i am looking forward to seeing how this goes  and hopefully  fingers crossed  science diet will really help him  i would like to assume it is the number one food for a reason 
product	these antlers were definitely not jumbo  more in the medium to large range  i was disappointed in this product  not as described 
product	our boxer loves these treats  but we got a bad with moldy treats  green and fuzzy like bad cheese   this is not amazon s fault  so i contacted the manufacturer via their phone number on the bag  i could not get a live person  so i left a message with my contact info  the product code and manufacturing date  i am disappointed that i got no response 
health	glad it is the allergy formula  hate the smell of the pockets themselves    and it transpires through their gas  good though
product	this is no 5 pack   it is one 6 3 bag of cat food  i am returning it  they tried to tell me the 5 pack meant 5 flavors   there are clearly 6 flavors listed <br  ><br  >they wanted to give me  10 credit to keep it   i can buy this at an expensive grocery store for  6  7   i can get a 13 5 lb bag for between  10  12 <br  ><br  >for almost  20 for this little bag of cat food is just crazy <br  >don t buy this unless you are expecting to pay a lot for a little    it is just one 6 3 lb bag <br  ><br  >very disappointed with this  i also got a 13 5 lb bag of meow mix tender centers salmon and chicken for  11 88    a much better deal  and generally a more expensive brand than friskies 
product	i liked it the one time we used it because it gave the dogs something to do and it was kind of funny to watch <br  ><br  >you have to use it on carpet  it slides around on tile and becomes pretty impossible <br  ><br  >i do not quite get the puzzle  it is more of a persistence thing  the dog can smell the treat under the yellow cover and scratches or bites at it until he or she gets it at the right angle and leverage to remove the yellow cover <br  ><br  >the idea when i got it was to have something that would occupy the dogs while i am a way  although it is obvious  i did not realize when i purchased it that once you get the yellow cover off and eat the treat  the next step is to chew up and the yellow covers  this means that this is a toy that i cannot leave alone with the dogs <br  ><br  >i would compare it to a very simple board game for children  it is easy  so they will not get frustrated  but it will not take them long  it is not difficult to clean up  but you will have to put it away immediately to keep it functional <br  ><br  >i still gave it three stars because it is what the seller said it was  there is not anything wrong with it  but i am not going to use it enough to get my money s worth 
health	i do not think it was stored correctly  my shih tzu became very sick after eating a can  a week later i tried another chance and he became sick again  i willnot give him anymore and i am stuck with 22 can 
product	i ordered the kauai luau for my dog    my very best friend in the world  what i received is the lahaina luau and each of the 12 cans are frozen solid  i do not think i can even feed this to my dog after it defrosts  can i  also new to me on the packaging of this product i did not order is a big white sticker that says   34 product of thailand  34    what the heck  i understood that this product was made in california usa  i am so so so so so so so so disappointed   not only did it take the package 10 days to reach me  the dog food i would waited so patiently for was not even in the box  and the   34 replacement  34  is frozen solid   and i mean solid  i do not even know if its safe to feed him canned food that is been frozen <br  ><br  >what s the deal  i am totally disillusioned by this purchase   i thought i could trust amazon   so much so that i told my only son he could trust purchases  now i am not so sure  how will you make this right amazon 
health	the cat with the actual urinary tract issues would not eat this  and either would the six other housecats  i was able to use up the tray by feeding it to the feral who comes by every evening  he ate it  i also donated half the tray to the local animal shelter 
health	these are full of crap  our poor kitty broke into the bag and ate too many and was vomiting for two days  be very careful how many you give and where you store them  or buy some that are natural and then they will not get sick of they overdose 
product	i have 2 caiques and for the price   i would not buy it again but worse   i cannot handle the smell  it is very strong  at first i thought my birds loved it and then i saw it all on the floor of the cage  they are used to a very healthy  pellet  fruit and veggie  pasta and some seed diet but this did not cut it and i could not handle the stench 
health	it came all crumbled up in the corners  fat was on it  i got this for the family dog and refuse to give it to her out of fear of diarrhea and choking  it just did not look smell feel right 
quality	these treats are about half the size of a typical training bite  our dog  who eats anything  was not interested  disappointing 
health	obviously  every dog is different  but these things made my dog very sick   he ate these and the other kong snowman looking treats  at first i thought that maybe he just had a catch in his throat  but after two days of these treats  he threw up and his stomach kept contracting  it was like he was dry heaving all day  it scared the mess out of me  needless to say  he has not done it anymore  it may be just a coincidence but he is not a sick or ill type dog  he is always healthy and happy  but after these treats his whole day was messed up 
health	this is my first review  i usually never bother  but after experiencing my cat getting sick and resorting to the internet to find out why  i decided to let everyone else know what i found out  i bought this food  after looking into a healthier alternative for my 3 yr old siamese based off of a friends recommendation that i should stay away from purina and other  grain  based feline diets  i switched my cat over and he seemed to like it just fine  he tends to be a gobbler  so i portion control him and have him eating from a feeder ball    lt which is awesome btw <br  > he immediately started vomiting  but knowing how my cat likes to eat his food too fast  i was not worried  when he started doing it multiple times throughout the day  and his litterbox usage started getting irregular i became worried  my bf even remarked that it seemed odd and thought it might be the food  i came home today and there was yellow bile vomit on the floor which he has never done  i immediately started researching why and if i need to take him to the vet and i found this link as one of the top results       <br  >needless to say i mtossing this bag right now and going out to buy my cat something else  all of the good reviews were from an older version  the 83 1 star ones were from the past couple months of the new improved formula  and i do not want to be one of those parents putting down their furry friend for trying to put them on a healthy diet    
product	if only the opening was a little smaller  i bought the small size because of other reviews i read  the size of the opening on the large dispenser toy all but dumped out the treats inside  so i thought the small size would be better  and it is somewhat better but the cutout is still too large and it takes my puppy next to no time to empty the dispenser <br  ><br  >still  she bats it around with her nose after she finishes so it extends it is usefulness  i am not sorry i purchased it but i would not buy it again 
product	over half of the biscuits broken into small pieces  dogs did like the biscuits  will not buy again because of the too small pieces 
health	we ordered these for my two west highland terriers   who love to chew  they looked great and my dogs loved eating them  they were very large so we broke small piece off to give them <br  ><br  >then things got ugly that night  we have had multiple bouts of vomiting and a lot of grass eating to settle upset stomachs  i will be throwing these out and will never feed them to our dogs again  i do not recommend this product unless you enjoy being woken up in the middle of the night by a retching dog 
health	after months  neither my dog nor myself has been able to get a kong treat out of the kong toy    well  i did manage to get it out  but tools were involved  my young border collie only plays with this when he cannot find anything else to drop in my lap  its odd shape makes it roll around to inevitably relocate itself as to become a hazard  i am basically done with any type of dog entertainment that involves stuffing something edible inside a toy 
quality	i bought these to try and save a few bucks over vetri lysine  unfortunately  this products is dry and has no distinct smell flavor that would attract a cat  mine will not go near them  so it was a complete waste of money and we had to buy vetri lysine after all 
quality	my dog will not eat these chicken jerky treats  was a waste of money for me  he just smelled them   walked away 
product	although the idea seems like a good one my kitty was just frustrated with this toy and i wish i had bought something else with my money  it is cute  made from cardboard and great packaging but just not worth the money 
quality	my pups did not like these  not sure why  but it was worth a try  we de hydrate real chicken breast and beef for them  so i was not really surprised when they sniffed it and walked away 
product	i know cat food never smells good  but this flavor reeks  once i open a can i can smell it throughout the house the entire day  will not buy this flavor again  but i love other flavors of purina one 
quality	this was poor quality  and my dogs only ate a few pieces  the rest was thrown away  expected better for the price  will not buy this brand again 
quality	my 14year old tabby just was not very interested  even with treats  even with my help she did not get what she was supposed to do with it 
quality	my yorkies were so excited when i was opening the package like they do when i give them their chicken jerky  when i got it out and broke it in half to hand each a piece they took it excitedly and immediately dropped it and sniffed it  they walked away  i left it for them to get used to and finally 4 days later picked up the hardened pieces that they never touched again and threw them away  it is not jerky at all  it is pressed together something in the shape of jerky  that is it  amazon took it back but i would not order it if you think it is jerky 
product	i opened the package and handed this to my dog  she dropped it out of her mouth and when it hit the floor it broke in half   
product	i thought this would be the same as i was buying in stores but this 25 lb  bag is mostly sunflower seeds  some peanuts but no other nuts  disappointed because i am having to buy better quality to mix with it  was not a savings at this rate 
quality	i bought this rabbit treat because a sales in pet food express once recommended it  she said all dogs love rabbit flavors products by zuke s  unfortunately my chow chow does not like it at all  she tried several times and all left it on the floor  oooooops              
product	this was advertised as a 6 pack of 4lbbags  i received one 4lb bag that cost me over  30 00  i did not know how to contact this company to get this taken care of  i just gave up  expensive rabbit   
product	be careful with these  i had previously gotten twistix bones in a bark box that were made in the usa so i felt comfortable ordering these  big mistake  luckily i looked at the back of the container before feeding them  they are made in china 
product	yes  your pup will adore these bones  they smell great  seem to taste delicious  and are long lasting  minimal crumbs  however    he will be covered in orange until you thoroughly wash him  which i am sure your pup will love   face  paws  belly  ears  all orange  anything soft where he chooses to eat this  say  his new white bed  will be orange as well  not worth it  go with the lamb and apple flavor instead  just as delicious with no orange mess   petite  size is perfect for my 5 pound havanese   toy poodle pup 
quality	i messed up  this cat food is a serious reject for all my 6 cats and even the ferals will not eat it  i put it out and then have<br  >to throw it in the trash the next day 
product	none of my cats wanted anything to do with these    <br  >donated them to the shelter and sure will not buy them again 
health	after eating the turkey   giblets my cats are getting sick <br  >some refuse to eat it <br  >they other two varieties are okay <br  >are any other cat owners experiencing this 
quality	my german shepherd dog have a tough time biting to it  its very hard  like rock hard  i just put some peanut butter on top of it so she eats it 
health	you suckers made my dog sick the vet said there was a big band on all this dog treats coming from china because their crap
quality	my dog hates these  will not eat them  but that is just him  product is nice because its made with natural and limited ingredients
product	i felt this was a lot of money for 3 small treats that my dog consumed in 5 minutes and he is a small pomeranian  i think its a healthy treat and if bigger it would last longer and be more satisfying to my dog  i do not hate the product as far as quality but i cannot give it more than 1 star as i feel it very overpriced  i do not mind spending the money on healthy treats as i spend  90 a a month on merrick flossies  expensive but a better value 
product	i have been buying these treats for 3 years online for my havanese  the shipments that have arrived in november and january have been horrible and uneatable by my small dog  they are so hard that i had to take a hammer to break them up for my 100 lb  german shepherd  he can eat them but using a hammer   really  i live out of the country so returning them is not an option  but i did recently go to a pet store in ca that stocks them   and talked to the store owner  they have had no problem with the product coming directly from the three dog bakery  i purchased a box that was the same quality that i used to get amazon  not sure what is going on   but i will not buy them again online 
health	i knew this food was very different than most dry cat foods when i opened the bag   it seemed like smaller bits of   34 meaty  34  style dog food  our cat seemed to like it but she kept vomiting it up and having bowel movements all over the house  which is very uncharacteristic for her  switching to another food  kit n kaboodle  solved the problem  pinning the issue directly on this food 
product	outside of the comments about pet health after eating these dog treats it is a rip off  read the fine print  3oz for 14 75  really  wal mart has the 14 5 oz package for  13 99 all day every day 
product	i ordered 4 cases of friskies wet cat food  including this flavor  there was zero packing material in the box the 4 cases came in  the box was too large and the cases had slammed around in the box during shipment  a total of 6 cans were busted and had to be thrown out  at least half of the remaining cans were dented     i ended up using them anyway as the seals had not broken  i have pictures of the damaged cans  which had leaked into the cases  what a mess  come on  no packing material

quality	my cat is not a picky eater  he usually eats whatever dry food we give him  however  he refused to eat this this food  even when we mixed it with purina indoor cat  far less expensive  he picked out the purina piece by piece and left the science diet in his bowl 
health	my puppy ate half of this bone in about an hour and he immediately threw it up after walking away from it  it is possible he has a lamb allergy or it just upset his stomach  needless to say  avoiding all lamb flavored things from now on 
product	this product arrived quickly  but i am very annoyed to find sugar as one of the ingredients in this mix  the list of ingredients online does not match the list of ingredients on the package   and this mix does not match the online list of ingredients from the volkman website   sunflower oil   sulfur dioxide are listed on the package  also soybean oil was the last ingredient listed   i say   34 was  34  because someone used a black marker to mark out   34 soybean oil  34  on the package  it appears that many of these items are not the healthiest thing to feed your bird <br  >i m wondering what happened to the volkman avian science super that listed hulled pumkin seeds as the first ingredient  and did not contain oils or sulfur dioxide   
quality	my cats do not like these  not sure why  would not purchase it again  i do like their frozen stuff though 
health	it worked for my sister s cat  unfortunately my cat go an allergy to this medicine and i had to take him to the vet 
quality	dog food arrived with the bag torn and all over the box  i do not know if the color change was from it getting dried out or if it is jus old  my dog dexter does not want to eat it so there has to be something wrong  have had no problem with it till this last bag 
product	bought the 4 10lb bags as a substitute for my product being discontinued  now i see how i missed that it is non clumping   because it only says it on the package in the photo <br  ><br  >online to find a better litter for next month 
product	do not be fooled by the description of this product    it is not litter   tootsie roll sized green logs  my 5 5 lb chipin will not even put her paws in it  went out and bought regular kitty litter and she box trained in one day  this grizzly salmon oil junk is the biggest waste of money i have ever spent  do not get scammed like i did    this is not litter    
product	i cannot believe i spent ten dollars for this toy  it is small and he could tear it up in a second if i let him have it   useless 
quality	my two indoor cats did not care for it   one licked it a few times but would not eat it  the feral cat that i feed loved it though 
product	the idea of this toy is good but my 30 lb dog  a vigorous chewer  ate both treat disks within an hour  this left him feeling poorly for the whole day  i did not realize that the dog would have to be monitored that closely in his initial time with the toy 
product	my dogs love checkups  however they are ridiculously expensive and i will not be purchasing them again anytime soon  with prices like this  having pets will only be affordable by the wealthy 
health	while my fish loved these  they do not sink  he could sense it because he was swimming around alert and on the hunt  but they just circulated around the opening  fluval edge  6 gallon   my platy does not really go to the opening much as he just waits for the flake food to be pushed down by the filter flow and then he swims and gobbles up the food  but that was not the case with these worms <br  ><br  >they were supposed to be his sunday treat dinner and since it appeared he was not going to get them i dropped in a light pinch of flake food and that is when he finally found the blood worms at the opening <br  ><br  >3 star rating because they do not sink  i plan on getting bottom feeders and shrimp and this was going to be a   34 community treat  34  in conjunction with their normal feedings but that is not going to work 
product	misleading   so many dogs have died from consuming treats made in china that the fda issued a warning concerning this travesty 
product	maybe i need to feed him a couple more pieces  but my russian tortoise does not really seem to notice that it is cactus or food  i have given him fresh cactus before and he loved it  maybe he is not used to this product yet  i do like having a variety of foods around and the ingredients in this product seemed up to my standards  i will be sure to try again  nothing is too good for my little dude   d
health	publix and many other grocery stores in many states have recalled this brand and refuse to sell it  it has many animals sick and killed some 
product	one main reason i enjoy giving my pet this aussie stick is because it is not made in china  they smell great  and my dog goes nuts for these  the reason i started buying them was because they would keep her occupied  but now she can literally chew up the entire thing in less than 5 minutes  so if you ve got a tough chewer like i do  i recommend a himalayan dog chew instead of this  plus i guess i am still torn about how i feel about giving her raw hides   
health	my poor dog got serious diarrhea after eating it  i fed him twice in the evening and then he got diarrhea and pooped inside the house during the night because he cannot hold it  it is really terrible 
product	i bought this product to add omega  3 fatty acid to my dog s diet to enhance her overall health  okay  i know they have to put something in it to entice dogs to eat their medicine  this being said  the number 1 inactive ingredient is artificial flavor and corn starch is  3  i am not really very happy about the inclusion of these garbage ingredients into what is supposed to be a healthy product  i know that each dose there is only a small quantity added to her diet but next time i will find an option that uses better quality inactive products to make it appetizing 
quality	sorry  it is my cat  he did not like it  just sniffed and walked away  tried twice  no luck  so it was a bad pick  the only one he likes it is the savory seafood  i gave it away and they tell me the other cats loved it  so just a matter of taste 
quality	i do not like this as well as the treat keep  i would not order again  it is well made  but too many treats come out at once 
quality	after ready the mixed reviews on this product i decided to give it a try  most of the sticks are very thin and even the thinner ones my doberman has then gone in minutes  they do seem to be low odor but as quickly as he goes through them they do not have a chance to get stinky  i will continue searching for a better bully stick made in usa 
product	these shrimp float and tend to stick to the sides of the tank  so my fish have a hard time finding them  when they do find them they gobble them up though  i probably will not buy them again  when my fish feed at the surface they tend to swallow air and then have trouble using their internal air bladder to sink  the swallowed air keeps lifting them to the top  and this lasts a few hours  so i switched to food that sinks 
product	the product is great but they have a packaging problem as the zip strip for closure is bad on the entire batch  contacted the manufacturer and their response was to use a chip clip 
quality	i purchase these dog treats at my local grocery and was excited to see them here cheaper  i ordered two sets of four  they arrived today and are as hard as stones and chalky white  they are not fresh  then i go on line to return them and find there are no returns or refunds from honest abbie  so now i am out  34 with no recourse but to post this review 
health	if you are looking for decent quality cat food than i would recommend this  if you are looking for high quality i would not recommend this  our cats love it  but we only feed it to them when we have no other cans left  we have a colony of 6 cats outside   they leave nothing behind  i would buy this for quick fixes and not a lifelong food  i noticed health issues with our babies when we fed them too much  it is amazing how much quality food makes a difference 
quality	after doing tons of research  i selected this food for my pup  in short order he started to emit a potent sour smell  coming out of his skin  not   34 fish breath  34  mind you   a nasty rotting garbage smell coming out of his body  we switched to newman s own dog food and the smell is gone completely  unless you want a seriously stinky dog  i would steer clear of this product 
health	after one of our small dogs choked on the chunk she was trying to swallow whole and the other small dog had some issues pooping and it turned out she had a large undigested piece in her rectum  i think we dodged a serious bullet  there and we immediately stopped feeding this product or others like it to our dogs 
quality	my betta does not like these  i have tried them a few times  hoping he would get a taste for them  but no luck  he nibbles a bite then immediately spits it out  the flakes also clouded the water and looked pretty foul in the bowl  so make sure to remove them if your betta s not biting right away 
quality	first few days my cat ate it and it found it interest but soon he decide to not eat it  i guess the flavor might not be that good because the cat usually likes everything
quality	i hoped this would be great for taking on hikes etc but it is almost impossible to get the thing to open and even when you do it then traps your fingers whilst you are trying to fish out a treat from the corners and seams they inevitably wedge themselves into  <br  ><br  >we persisted over time but it really has not softened up any so now it just sits in the back of a drawer and does not get used at all 
quality	i put her medicine in the pill pocket and i noticed that she did not touch it for a while so she either ate it or hid it not sure
quality	i purchased this item for my 76 pound suspected labrador mix  never know as he was acquired from the spca   he loves to chew   he is an aggressive chewer  we have kong products  but he prefers items with odors and tastes  unfortunately the plastic toys do not have much flavor  this product arrived today at approximately 1130 hours   it was cracked by approximately 1145 hours  it is not the long portion of the bone which cracks  but rather the epiphysis  the bone smells horrid   has a greasy coating  i do not like that  but the dog does  i will say the bone is not cracked to a degree i am concerned about splinters  but i expected more than a good 15 minutes before any cracking  what can you say  it is the bone of an animal and animals are subject to fractures  i would purchase again  but at a more reasonable price  i must say this is currently his favorite object to chew 
product	these are not bully sticks  my little dog can chew a bully stick for hours  he devoured this thing in less than ten minutes  wish i had not bought these  they are too much money for such little chewing  i would definitely recommend the canine caviar bully sticks but the braided ones are not a good product  i will definitely try to return these 
product	the dog  of course  loves these  but boy are these messy  i rate it 3 stars because at least half the container was powder or tiny broken pieces around the size of peas  not in shape   easy and excellent to crumble atop dog chow if that is what you are purchasing for  but as training treats  i feel they fail because the sizes are just too varied  plus your fingers get covered in fine liver powder <br  ><br  >i m not purchasing again due to its messiness for training  but as a meal additive i may consider it again in the future 
quality	this may be great for bigger dogs  but my yorkie just mouthed the treat until the tablet fell out  then she still did not eat the treat 
quality	i got these with the package split open  there was a black bug that was still alive immersed in the pizzle sticks  i was so disgusted  i immediately wrapped them in shrink wrap to contain the bug  i hope no others escaped and are currently multiplying in my home  very scary  i am now kinda cautious to get food products from amazon  hopefully this was a fluke since i buy everything from amazon  it is scary to see such poor quality control 
quality	our two rescued pit bulls loved these tripe sticks    they were literally just chopped  dried tripe  nice and stinky  like when my sicilian grandpa boiled it in the morning to make tripe and eggs in tomato sauce    but the last package i bought was completely different    no more tripe texture  just thin  see through pieces and not nearly as stinky  our pitties no longer like them  i bought some from a new zealand pet supply company that are like these used to be  i write a newspaper column called \\ sky s picks\\  where i share some of the many treats we try and i had these on my list  but not now that they changed them completely  too bad  they were perfect just the way they were  why mess with a good thing 
product	came in a very timely manner  but when i opened the package there was an expired coupon for a photo site  and the box was ripped and a few cans dented  it served it is purpose and fed my babies though 
product	my little dog found them very hard to chew and did not like the taste at all  i think they are highly over rated and over priced  but maybe that is my personal opinion only  judge them for yourself 
health	i bought these for our mini poodle for christmas because they were made in the usa and the reviews were good  when we gave her the first bone she loved it and we saw no side effects  but a week later when we gave her another one she she threw up busy bone colored stuff and was sick to her stomach afterwards  she almost never gets sick or throws up so we are sure it was this product  upon further research google  \\ busy bone throwing up\\  or even the one or two star reviews on amazon of similar products have reports of dogs throwing up  getting digestive infections  and one poor dog eventually dying after being fed one of these treats  the ingredients inside are unnatural and can cause serious side effects  we will never give our poodle another one of these things again  here is a website that describes what is in these things       
product	since my cats loved the instinct raw formula i thought i would try this for treats for them  their reaction has generally been meh     they do not hate it but not particularly impressed either  probably will not buy again 
health	this product did not remove the cough and in fact made it even worse  it got my poor dog sick and now she feels horrible  also i did give her the recommended dosage so i did not do anything wrong when giving my dog this horrible product  i do not recommend this to anyone 
health	our golden is very sensitive to certain   34 fillers  34  in dog food  a skin allergy  to be precise  which is worsened by consuming corn  when i bought this my decision was based on the emphasis on   34 natural  34  and   34 lamb  34  and   34 rice   34  what i did not realize is the amount of corn in the mix  i am not saying this is necessarily a bad product  just bad for our dog  and any other dog with a sensitivity to corn 
quality	i found it be too dry when i applied it to my dog s dry food  he does not like it anymore 
health	i have dachshunds and this ball is just too hard and not maneuverable enough for them  might work better with a medium size dog like a beagle or terrier  it is too small and therefore dangerous for a large dog  really odd my fur kids do not like it since by nature dachshunds are chow hounds but they ignore it  other treat dispensers are very popular with them  just not this one 
health	my parrot loved this mix b c of the high peanut content but we just recently had an emergency with her as she contracted aspergillosis from the moldy peanuts in this mix  the mold in peanuts is not as discernable as mold on bread  it can be invisible to the naked eye  i am returning this product for that reason  i will never feed my parrot a peanut product again  please be careful with your feathered babies 
product	i bought these bully sticks after reading the description as   34 large  34   when i received them i was disappointed to see that they came in different sizes  many either very short or very thin  my dog enjoyed them regardless  but for the price i feel i got less than a value 
quality	dogs like but i do not care for the over priced treats  too few for the amount charged  there are many more treats of this quality at much better pricing  i have spent over  200 the last few years and found i was not doing right by the purse 
health	i bought this for our young german shepherd belgian malinoise white swiss shepherd mix and our older rough collie  the pup is a destructive chewer and this was perfect for while he was penned up to keep him occupied and happy  we had to get one for our older dog because she could not understand why she was always good and was not getting such a delicious treat  after all  she was not being naughty and could be trusted with free reign of the house  so  we bought one for her  too  they both loved them  i thought they were great <br  ><br  >we used them first under total supervision  then when they appeared to be safe  we gave one to each dog when we were going to be gone for a few hours  the only problem i had was getting the disc into place  if it was so hard to get the disc in  it should be hard to get the disc out  right  well  for a while  yes  until they figured out how to get it out  my first sign this had happened was when i came home after being gone two hours  and found our collie at the back door when i came in  very strange     she always greets at the front door  i realized something was very wrong with her  something appeared to be lodged at the back of her mouth  she had either been trying to swallow it or to break it up in her back teeth  she was in distress and i had to get it out for her mouth  it turned out to be a large chunk of one the treat discs  there appeared to be blood on it from her mouth  the younger dog had figured out how to get the disc out and this large chunk somehow got out of his pen  which the older dog stole <br  ><br  >fortunately  she is okay  but i will never buy this again and strongly recommend against buying this  if she had managed to swallow that big chunk  i would very likely have ended up with a dead family member 
product	this treat is liked by the dogs but it goes fast and seems to be pricey  i have two cocker spaniels and they each get one and then later get another one half each  for  3 00 i think that is too expensive and even though they like it i will think twice before buying it again because of the price and small quantity 
quality	cats do not like it  prefer pât eacute   you should try s can from grocery before you order a case or subscribe
quality	my dog loved these when i purchased them from the pet store  but the ones i received through amazon were all dried out     <br  >i plan to return and try again   will post again 
product	i do not know why  but i was expecting this to be bigger  it is about the size of tennis ball which is pretty perfect for the kittos  i would been having a hard time getting the cats to eat their dental treats but now that it is   34 fun  34  they seem more apt to enjoy them  they do not really chase it around the house like i was hoping  for the exercise  but it does occupy them and they go into   34 stalk attack  34  mode with it so they are definitely getting some mental stimulation out of it  one of my cats will actually pick up the ball by the small opening and carry it around like a dog playing fetch   so funny <br  ><br  >here are the only cons that i am experiencing <br  >1  it is made of durable plastic which is very noisy going across the tile floor  carpet is totally fine <br  >2  there are two openings  a big one to stuff the treats through which then gets covered up by the colored cap and then a smaller one for the treats to come out of during play  the smaller opening might be too small for some of the treats that i have turning the ball into a big rattle  i will try to buy some smaller treats otherwise it is just a toy that rolls and rattles 
quality	my cat has had urinary troubles for months and i hoped this food would help heal her  it does not seem to have made much difference  probably because she does not have crystals  also  the food causes her to poop a lot and it smells awful  so now her litter pan smells bad   and she will not go back in the litter pan after she is pooped  so now she is urinating on my carpet <br  ><br  >this is obviously good quality food and has helped lots of animals with crystals  it just is not the right food for my cat 
quality	my cat does not like iit will not play with it <br  >poor excuse for a cat toy  money wasted  no action 
product	this products is not worth it even if it was free  i lost close to  3000 of corals mostly sps and still did not eradicate the parasite  this clearly was not tested on all corals to prove it is reef safe  and i had a spike in ammonia further proving that it did affect my biological filtration unlike their false claims  if you have some expensive sps and lps corals in your tank that you do not want to kill then do not use this product  i have about  1000 of fish i wanted to save but either removing them to a quarantine tank or letting them die would have been much better than killing  3000 worth of corals some very rare i had for over 5 years  soft corals were affected too but recovered eventually  nice maxima clam died  sponges died 
product	i saw all the wonderful ratings here on amazon  but my two cats did not enjoy this soft food  they would eat it  reluctantly  after discovering that i would not give them anything else  since it was so expensive  i was disappointed 
product	actually my dogs love these bars  but they arrived all smashed and broken  i sent a message to amamzon but it was not acknowledged  i have ordered these bars previously and they arrived fine  in the future i will probably go to the pet supply store to buy them  i loved the fact that they were sent right to my door but having them delivered all broken is a total waste of money 
product	my dog did not like them as much as happy hips so i probably will not buy them again  otherwise i am satisfied with delivery ontime
product	the pieces are smallish and quite thin  no problem with my dogs enjoying them  but  definitely overpriced  not worth the purchase price 
health	started giving my two cats this couple of weeks ago  immediately after eating  they would vomit this dry food right back up  absolute worst  never again 
product	i wanted to return this as soon as i got it  it really is impossible to properly tighten the lid  making it very messy and frustrating to put it into the feeder  i only gave it two stars because once it is in the feeder  the water flows fine  but i do not want to get soaked every time i try to fill that up  so i got a different one  this one is not worth it 
product	i love starmark and have used them for a while  this was my first time using the vanilla mint flavor and for whatever reason  it did not hold within the toy the way the other flavors have  total waste of time and money as the purpose of these extremely expensive toys are to entertain the dog for hours    this one is 5 minutes and then finished  do not waste your time 
product	like the concept but my corgi shepherd is a strong chewer  she was starting to break off pieces within an hour so had to take it away  disappointing because kong products usually work for her  back to stuffing dentastix pieces into the kong bones  will keep looking for another treat dispenser to keep her occupied longer when i have company 
product	do not get caught up in the hype   or think that a higher cost means a better product  i have an american bulldog pit bull mix and these toys came highly recommended to me  i purchased two of them and it was a total waste of money  first off  he was smart enough to rip the   34 treat  34  part out in about 15 seconds  yes  it was all the way in and put in correctly  i took the toy from him and put them back in  but he is strong enough and intelligent enough that he just had them pulled back out again in under a minute  and the plastic rubber toy   it is not hard  it is actually very soft and supple and he shredded that in about 30 minutes  i paid a lot of money for these and they lasted less than 30 min  i would not suggest these for dogs who are intelligent  strong  or aggressive chewers   don t be surprised if they are a waste of money for you too 
product	by the time this got to my house it was nothing but a bucket of powder   completely worthless  i will never buy this product again 
product	my cats have gone through bags and bags of the cat man doo bonito flakes  the cats wanted nothing to do with the bellyrubs brand  the cat man doo flakes have a pink hue while these were brown  odd  i threw the bag out and was happy that i had some of the cat man doo left  really surprised and disappointed 
health	fortiflora provided zero relief for my dog who had   34 loose stool   34  my vet recommended trying it  i went through 3 boxes trying to give it time to kick in  ultimately  it was worthless for her  i went through a ton of foods and wound up finding that my dog simply needed a grain free kibble instead  now she is good to go  actually  i mix 50 50 of nutro high energy and a castor and pollux grain free  <br  ><br  >i recommend being patient if you are having issues and trying as many foods as you can  definitely try grain free  though  i mean    do you think wild wolves are eating rice  heck no  so  why would we give them crap fillers so dog food companies can bank that profit   pepper did ok on just the nutro high energy for a short while before the grossness returned 
product	if you are expecting the usual  pockets  from this distributor  you are not going to get it  i opened the package and all the  pockets  had been squished together making a few mashed up piles of the product  did not have a choice but to use what was delivered since i needed to give my dog her meds right away  i will never order from this distributor again 
quality	i have purchased this product in a store previously and found it worked great  the packages i got from amazon were very dried out and crumbly  which made it difficult to wrap around the medicine  the price was great  but if this is commonly what i would be getting i will have to go back to the pet store to buy them  i do not know if the product is old or if it got dried out in transit or what the problem may be  i was disappointed 
product	we loved this toy  it quickly became a favorite  but my dog can periodically turn into a heavy chewer and today for whatever reason he decided to start on this one  i had to toss it  i probably will not buy a new one  once he chews a toy all replacements meet the same fate 
health	this food did not smell anything like i thought blood worms would smell like  the container was sealed when i got it  so nothing was switched  my betta must have noticed too because he would not even taste it  he would only smell it and swim away  to be fair i have never smelled blood worms before  so i have no others to compare them to  this is why i will not give it a one star rating 
product	very disappointed  i have been buying this product for several years from local pet stores and online  and this is the first time i have had a problem with them just falling apart as i tried to put the pill inside has the formula changed 
product	as title says  only about a third of the package was good quality bully sticks that i normally buy for my dog <br  >the rest were these thin  shriveled strips of what i presume to be made of the same material as bully sticks  but i am hesitant to give these to my dog <br  >very disappointing purchase  since the delivered product looks nothing like the picture shown  except for the label  <br  >i d rather pay a more expensive price to buy actual bully sticks for my dog  will never buy these again 
product	i ordered this to give my brother for his dog and unfortunately the bones were completely crushed when the package arrived  i am embarrassed to give this as a gift   so it was a complete waste of money 
health	i have three very healthy cocker spaniels with cast iron stomachs  these were virtually impossible for them to digest  each time i tried to feed them to them i invariably found vomit on the floor  such a shame  i had three bags and i ended up throwing them all out 
product	the wipes a year ago were awesom  the new type of wipes are terrible n cheap  they r to thin n useless when wiping poop    parents choice needs their old thicker wipes back  they r a waste of money now n i wont buy them till they r the thicker ones     
quality	not stinky smelling or slimy but not interesting to the dogs  these things are really hard and dogs are not interested 
product	i mean its all here  but its just a bag of loss crumbled bits and pieces that at one time were the product in the pecking cake form  i feel like 6 50  was kind of a rip off 
quality	it may be great nutritionally but does not do much good if the cats do not eat it  i have three cats and none of them liked it 
quality	these treats are a perfect size for training  however  they smell so terrible i hate to handle them  also  the strong odor holds the dog s concentration and makes it difficult to attend to what i am instructing  i think i can do better with small pieces of carrot  wish you had such a small treat without the   34 stink   34   perhaps you can recommend a regular doh chow that has tiny pieces i could use one at a time  i will not recommend these and will ask the advice of my professional service dog trainer for a recommendation 
product	it is okay   the cats seem to like it  but it is kind of rich for one of my cats  the delivery was prompt and packaging fine 
product	for as much as these chews cost  it was not worth it  i can get much bigger deer chews at the local pet store at a better price 
product	i received the order promptly but since i do not usually give my dog rawhide  i was disappointed when they sent me the wrong rings  i used them this time since i did not want to hassle with the return  make sure you specify gnawhide  which has no rawhide 
quality	the little strange bones were for a morkie or chihuahua  my part chow just looked at them  smelled them and walked away  took them next door where a morkie lived  he wouldn  touch them either  what a waste of money 
product	stay away from purchasing the 1 ounce bag of whole life freeze dried venison  it is more costly that buying a 2 ounce or larger bag and the treats were harder than usual 
health	buy the sulfur stuff you mix up and put in your own bottle  trim fur back on baddest boo boos so air flow is increased <br  >don t freak and treat bedding and everything  ringworm spores are always everywhere  do not bother treating other pets  does not matter <br  >check yourself for ringworm and treat with athletes foot stuff from drugstore   ask pharmacist which is best  resistant  see dermatologist or primary physician as there is stronger cream for humans <br  >expect to designate any towel you use as   34 cats sulfur towel   34  smell never comes out <br  >this was cream was stuck in cats hair for weeks   and i only put it on the spots where i trimmed the hair back <br  >chunky crunchy tacky crystal y  poor cat did not deserve this cream <br  >smells 10xs worse then the spray 
quality	subject line says it all  it is supposed tobe the most healthy  but is too expensive if they do not eat it 
product	the product description promotes this as virtually indestructible and for aggressive chewers so i was excited to try it  well  my dog  70 lb doberman  did enjoy it  for about 20 minutes before he was breaking off chunks  so in the trash it went  expensive 20 minute play session    sigh 
health	i was forced to refund  30 on 13 puppies because they were all infested with hookworms  i treated each puppy with this wormer 5 times before they went to their new home  do not buy this   
quality	i have a dog that desperately needs these  he is certainly food motivated and loves his treats  but sadly  he will not eat these 
health	this is a nice toy but is not as sturdy as they seem to think  my puppy was able to chew the legs off in a matter of hours  this toy can cause choking if a small piece gets lodged in their throat  shipping was very quick for this product 
product	called the ones that made this  said that they have started adding glycerin to this product which makes it chewy  my dogs like them crispy so now i have to find somewhere else to get thm crispy       very disappointed   
quality	sorry but my chickens are not eating this  neither are any other animals i have in my backyard  will not buy again 
product	i have normally gotten the other flavors of the lucky pet brands and tried this flavor for the first time  my dogs do not really like this one and snub it most of the time  also  not sure if normal or not  but this bag i got was hard as rocks  someone mentioned crumbles in bag    these are so hard they are not able to crumble  in fact  they are hard to bite for my small dogs  so i had to use a hammer to chop into small pieces so they could bite into easier <br  >so  i do not know if my dogs dislike this for the flavor or the hardness of it <br  >i ll keep giving them the other flavors and the softer  crumblier texture  and this one will never be ordered again 
product	these serve their purpose  and they arrived moist in the packet  i ve bought them at the vet s  and they were practically dried up   i still think they are overpriced  though 
health	dog got sick  his guts got all twisted up for a while day  do not buy products with gluten for you animals 
quality	cannot say it is a bad product just because my bird  cockatoo  does not like it but he will not eat any of it  he is a bit picky so that may explain a bit but he definitely does not care for these  they are quite hard so thought he might enjoy biting them but does not seem to have any interest  i put some out for the outdoor birds and they did seem to be interested but could not break the pieces  they re a bit large for finches  
product	i used to buy these at costco  but last time i was there they did not have them anymore  they are definitely good for keeping plaque and yellow buildup off my dogs  teeth  in fact  after a couple weeks of having half a checkup before bed time  my older dog s teeth were noticeably cleaner and whiter <br  ><br  >i am used to the checkups from costco being fresh  and when i break them in half they bend a lot and break softly  the package i received from this seller was pretty dry  and snapped violently when i broke one in half  i actually almost injured my hand due to this  i am going to look for a different seller  the product is great  but it really needs to be fresh <br  ><br  >i put a damp paper towel in the package and the next day it was a little better  the treats a little softer  did this a couple more times and they were almost like they should be  but i suspect the package was pretty old stock 
product	my dog did not like them much  he preferred the cat treats i bought  but then it turned out he is allergic to everything  i am sure some dogs will love it  but apparently it was not real peanut butter enough  because my dog loved peanut butter in celery n
product	i bought this for my kitten because they are supposed to be a more healthy treat  any time i try to give him one he is very uninterested  also  the pieces are very sharp  not worth the money 
product	i knew what the product was like and was not disappointed with it  my dog loves them and they keep her teeth really clean  the service was good but i believe the product is over priced on amazon  but i liked the free shipping 
health	i know this is non returnable  but fyi  this is my first time buying this dog food  and it made both my little dogs very sick  i should have known by the smell  but i ignored it  the dogs just ate a little bit of it  if you are keeping track of complaints  add my name  i will stick to cesar
product	my dog likes the treats but too much money  11 95   it is only 4oz <br  >my fault for not paying attention to the weight 
quality	i am always trying out new treats with my 7 dogs to mix it up for them  so i tried these treats on them as well  my treat package arrive with these in small bit   pieces  so not much for my to hold onto and hand to them  so i just sprinkled the floor with some of them and my dogs ate them up  so my dogs loved them  i just do not like how they come in crushed up pieces 
product	buyer beware this product is made in china even though it is packaged in a us facility  too bad because my dog would love these 
product	this product did not work on any of my dogs  it was a total waste of money  even the packaging was cheap 
quality	very difficult to get the mix to dissolve in warm water  and my eat anything dog would not touch them 
product	fresh out of the box  i filled the tub with water and sealed the bottom piece  turned upside down and water started leaking out for everywhere  kind of an issue when the screw top is not water tight  i would give this 0 stars if i could  returning to amazon for a refund tomorrow 
quality	my dog goes through this brand of bull stick significantly faster than other brands i have purchased  my dog will go through one of these sticks in one to two hours  the ones i buy from my local pet store last at least an entire day  additionally  this brand of bull stick smells horrible when moistened by my dogs saliva  30 minutes into my dog chewing one  the entire room smells bad  this is not the case with other bull sticks i have purchased  i will not be re purchasing this brand 
product	i ordered 2 of these bones for 2 80lb dogs  besides the fact that they are not 14inch  they are 9 and 8 inch  one bone is half the size around as the other which will probably cause a problem between my 2 dogs  so i am quite disappointed with the sellers false advertisement  i should have just went to petco 
quality	my pet would not eat this product even when i crushed it up and put the product in the food  you may have better luck  it did not work for me 
product	my cats used to enjoy these treats  but have grown tired of them  i have a subscription for them which i am going to cancel  when i started these as a subscription item  i considered many other cat food treat items  i found that the cost was more than i had expected  when i took amazon s prince and divided it my the number of cans or bags in the package  i found most to be more expensive than the grocery store or a large pet supply store  i was surprised  because amazon usually beats out others price wise <br  >but i did not find this to be true on the subscription items for cats  all that i checked were several cents more per unit than what i now pay  i selected this items because all of my cats  6  were liking this treat at the time  i am going to stop the subscription  they have tired of the flavor 
health	my dog loves it  but i am afraid of the publicity surrounding the product having to do with getting animals sick  if not for that it is a great product  i am afraid i am leery of any of these products made in china 
health	kitty loves them  however at the recommended serving size of 12 per day  it will be cost prohibitive to buy more  others have noted their kitty continues occasional vomiting even with these  same here 
quality	at first taste  3 kitties were very happy     but by the 3rd piece they were all gagging over the powdery texture the pieces broke into and they would not eat any more  later i soaked some in warm water for 30 minutes and one kitty enjoyed them then  but the other 2 actually backed away from their bowls 
quality	we use these for our elderly border collie who requires medication twice a day  unfortunately  the pouches purchased from this vendor contained dried out pill pockets that crumble instead of softly surrounding the pills  i am very disappointed  although these are only half the price of the same product i can buy locally  i will probably go back to my local store for fresh ones 
health	it helped my cat and my cat loved it  but it did not cure the problem i did find something at pet smart 
quality	my two dogs will not eat the stuff  i will either mix with beneful or throw it out  does not matter how beneficial it is if dogs run from it
product	alpo is great  my dog loves it  10 of the 12 cans were so dented it was hard to imagine how that came about  i would not buy those off the shelf at a brick and morter location  true it is only dog food but the ring pull tops do not fare well when the denting is severe 
product	so disappointing  my yellow nape amazon was terrified of this  i put it in her cage immediately after it came  she would not come out of the corner of the cage until i took it out <br  ><br  >returning it 
quality	i bought three bags of these because they were less expensive than purchasing from the vets office  now i know why  the pills are partially dried out and crumble when you try to put the pill in the pocket  i opened a 2nd bag hoping the first was just a bad lot and had the same issue <br  ><br  >this is a great product when it works  i wont buy these again from this vendor  ill stick with the ones from the vet as i know they will be fresh 
quality	unfortunately  my cats do not like it and will not eat it  it is probably a very good product  but not if the cats will not eat it  i have tried mixing it with the food i have been giving them  but if i put them side by side  they do not eat it  if i mix it thoroughly  they do not eat any of it 
product	pricey  my dog loves these  she cannot have much protein due to kidney failure  so this is a great treat for her 
product	generally  most of the fleas seem to die  but two days later i still found some on my cats  frustrating 
product	my kittens loved it  i cannot really remark as to the effects it had on them  i did not really notice shiny coats and whatnot   but they chow down on it without hesitation  the bummer is the price  i bought it just for a trial run  to buff them up 
product	does not do anything for my dog still barks and still neurotic with running all over the house but did receive package fast
quality	she does not like them that much  she likes the smokehouse poppers  this was the first time i order them 
quality	my cat sometimes will not eat it  i guess she does not know it is good for her or how expensive it was 
health	the product is ok  but it seems to make my english greyhound sick  his stools are very soft  even runny  after fully chewing on one of these  he loves them  but they do not love him   
product	so i do not know if i received a defective product or something  but the treat that came with this item did not even fit into the toy  i have used this toy before and i know that the toy holds the heart shaped treats  but it was the star shaped treat that came with the toy  and of course  the refills i ordered were also star shaped  so this toy was pretty much useless to me since the treats did not snap in properly  fortunately i was able to shove the treats into the kong tire chews  and i also ended up buying the nylabone rubber toy that you can stuff treats into  still  how does the actual treat that comes with the toy in the packaging not fit 
product	my dogs love them  not sure if they are cleaning their teeth  but i still buy them  dental bills are expensive 
product	my dogs wanted to eat these but oh goodness  they smelled terrible and reminded me of dried up bugs or something  yuck  will not buy these again 
quality	they love them… they will eat them without any hesitation  but my bt has worse stinks when he eats these…  clear the room kind of stinks
product	let me get this straight   kong designed a toy for dogs to figure out how to get treats out of and then made the plastic so weak that i scratched it just trying to get the packaging off  seriously  you know a dog is going to gnaw on the ends of this thing  you know people buy kong because they are designed to stand up to anything  you know this plastic does not meet the standard customers expect of kong  so why did you do this   it would have been an awesome toy if it was made out of something i thought i could give my dogs for more than 3 seconds 
product	my 10lb terrier destroyed this ball in under a week  and i bought the medium sized ball  too  for a name like   34 chew ball   34  it certainly does not seem to be meant for chewing  disappointed 
product	i have heard from many people these are the best  most indestructible bones out there  not for my 50 pound pit mix  i will not buy another one but glad i bought on amazon for a great price 
product	very expensive for a spread cheese  i found that i could use other cheese or sunflower seed butter spread instead  it is usually a better decision to use your own treats in the kong toys 
product	make sure this is packed properly  i have sent the following to amazon at their request for feedback on their shipping problem <br  ><br  >     <br  ><br  >amazon s shipping department usually matches the box and packaging to the product  not this time  a 12 can flat of dog food was poorly cushioned  using thin plastic air pillow surrounds  all of the air cushions had exploded  the cans were contained by the manufacturer s packaging  which consists of an outer thick plastic shrink wrap  and a half carton cardboard base  despite the retention of all 12 cans in the manufacturer s packaging  the amazon outer box was damaged  the amazon sealing tape was split on the ends  and four of the 12 cans were dented to the point our automatic can opener would not make the trip around the edge of the can <br  ><br  >my suggestion is to use newspaper  you own the washington post  to crumple around the manufacturer s package and provide a more resilient cushion for this relatively heavy item <br  ><br  >i am returning the four damaged cans and hoping for a replacement before the dogs get too hungry 
quality	one cats likes them but the other cat turned up his nose and would not touch them  for the cat that likes them  seems like quality ingredients and my vet really did recommend them 
quality	my little dog would not touch this jerky  she just did not like it  it probably is good  but peanut does not like it 
health	did not work at all  after going through the whole treatment cycle there was almost no change in the ear mite infestation in my lab 
product	my 30lb and 65lb dog both worked at this toy for hours and cannot get any treats out  i feel cruel even giving it to them as i myself can barely get any size treat out of it without working really hard  unless you leave a portion of the treat hanging out the edge  this toy is not really practical or fun for my furry kids   
quality	my cats love it and i was really hoping that it would be healthy for them  but i just got back from the vet and she said it contains a lot of bad ingredients  cats only need protein and this has a lot of carbs and soy and ingredients that are bad for cats on the long run  tikki cat is one of the best in the marker  check it out 
health	our cat will only eat food with seafood flavors in it  he has been an outdoor cat for years  he is probably close to 11 in age  i purchased him something else recently and the hairballs were horrible  he would leave them on the back patio instead of hacking them up in the neighbor s yard <br  ><br  >this is a good sized bag  a good price  and i am a prime member so it works out <br  ><br  >and i did try giving him more expensive  better quality food and he did not eat any less of it  still acted like we starve him to death and cries at the back door 2x a day almost like clockwork <br  ><br  >since i have had this bag of food he has not hacked up any hairballs on the patio so i would say it is a success <br  ><br  >1 3 14 <br  >since i originally wrote this review i haven noticed hairballs again on the back patio  my son and i selected another food from a local store to try instead  i took a star away since it did not control hairballs 
health	built for up to 10lbs dog  my albs dog was able to tear the inside out and almost choked herself to death on the inner fabric  on day 1 of use 
product	my cat had seizures during the night  treatment was put on that morning  due to the strong smell still on her when seizure happened i immediately suspected the treatment as cause   tried to wash off what i could  i called vet next day   he said he has known of this problem and wants me to bring the package to him tomorrow  my cat is old  after one day of not moving or eating she seems little better now 
product	not that i hate the product   but you are only getting one stick  the picture shows 4 and the only place in the listing that indicates you might get one stick is the title where it says  treat  in the singular  this will be going back since  15 for one is a rip off 
product	this worked well and was a great value  but my cat refused to drink from it  so we will go back to a more expensive fountain  gave it to a friend whose dog happily slurps from it 
product	my treat dispensing toy of preference is the kong wobbler  which is basically a weeble that you can fill with kibble and the dog bats it around and treats fall out  the only drawback of the wobbler is how loud it is  because it is hard plastic  gave this treat ball a try  and it is ok  the kibble fits in pretty easily and it is soft plastic so it is quiet  however  there is no other way to get the kibble out besides rolling the ball on the ground  the wobbler also opens for humans to fill and empty it   when there were only a couple kibble left  the dog could not get them out and it was hard for me  too  also  my dog  70lb lab  is not an aggressive chewer  but when he got frustrated he tried to chew this open  and he would have been able to if i had not stopped him  not for dogs who are tough on toys  i will probably use this when i do not want to deal with the noise of the kong toy  but it is not my first choice 
quality	my cat would not touch these  one sniff  and he was gone  after that  he did not even come near it 
health	used to give these a four as zoe loves them so  unfortunately i never realized they are not grain free  all these years and we had no idea they were contributing to her allergies  while we should have checked more carefully we do wish it was posted on the box a little more clearly  plus  now that we found both whimzees and minties that are grain free we know it is possible to make dental chews without the dreaded itch causing substance  especially given we spend much less on either of those products than we had to on greenies 
health	i cannot tell why it sometimes works and then some months it doesn t  i guess it has to do with the seasons and how bad the fleas are in the area  i began using this because the trifexis pill is dangerous 
product	one of the cans was dented and opened  otherwise the order was good  we will order this product again  end
quality	cheap  poor quality  not worth the price  the flip top is difficult to open and close  seals poorly  the jar itself is of thin plastic 
health	unhealthy  the cat that i inherited was accustomed to this food  i have now transitioned her to a healthier food 
product	the picture made this look like a refillable toy that we could put catnip in  it is  in fact  a solid ball of catnip that the cats like  but it is actually an edible treat  so we have no idea how long this will last  but it is a bit pricey for a small 1  34  diameter ball  but the cats do play with it 
health	they must have changed something because all three of my wife s cats now refuse to eat this newest bag even though they loved the last two bags purchased <br  ><br  >update  i talked with science diet this morning and was told the formula was changed over a year ago  the \\ best before\\  date is 3 2015 so i am sure i have a bag with the new formula  i can not check the dates on the bags of my previous purchases but i am sure they were the new formula  as i doubt amazon has a bunch of old stock  so  maybe it is just this bag  amber asked me if this bag smelled different  it smells like cat food  not real pleasant  but i did not sniff the previous bags so i have nothing to reference too <br  ><br  >i bought a bag of sd light hairball control and the three cats are now feeding in their normal ways 
quality	i do not doubt these treats are healthy    because my dog is less than enthused about them  there is plenty of them in a box and they are a bit bigger than peanut sized  i purchased them after our mini dachshund was told to loose weight  some days she will willingly take them  some days she turns her nose up     
quality	my turtle is smart and there is not much else to say but she will not even look twice at these ones
health	my dogs did not really like them     of course they are very picky  i purchased it because they thought one of the dogs had food allergies 
health	got these because the plaque is starting to build up on my 4 year old labradors teeth  however this is not a replacement for teeth brushing  she was vomiting after eating them for a while and i think the large is too much  i purchased the large  she is a 60lb lab pointer minx  but for the price the large ones are totally not needed  make sure you a lot for the calorie intake as well  i purchased the regular size ones and its much better 
product	it is been a pretty tough flea season this year  along with all of the diligent inside work done  we still have a few on the dogs  we have been using frontline for years and it worked pretty well til this year  bought this with the hopes of success  not really  we are still fighting them here in late november and we have had plenty of sub freezing weather here in maryland  the advantix seems to help but when we comb the dogs  3 labs and an irish wolfhound  several times a day  we never find dead ones  only live ones  believe me  we have done everything necessary from vacuuming rugs and furniture and crates daily to washing bed sheets and blankets and using a natural flea spray that does work on the dogs  i do not want to bomb the house though  hopefully the effort and the cold weather will eventually win out
quality	unimaginable intensity  nastiest odor you can find is securely sealed in these pill pockets  i have tried chicken flavor from another seller  and it was all good  not a trace of nasty smell <br  >it seems that this product is expired or something  i could not exchange it because i have opened them the last  and now i have to just throw them away   last return day was yesterday  i do not like the service at all  
product	i wish they had made this so you could increasingly make it harder  the kibble falls out way to easily for them  so the work for food puzzle is over too fast and the dogs are bored shortly afterwards <br  ><br  >but i still would have bought it  when doing food puzzles  especially with a rescue dog that has never used one  it is good to start off with a toy that is easy  that would be this one for sure <br  ><br  >but be sure to pick it up when it is empty and do not let the dog chew it like a chew toy  my dog that i lovingly call   34 jaws  34  bit into the blue plastic  i got it away from her before it broke  but it would have if i had not been alert <br  ><br  >it is human error when a dog toy gets chewed up  read the package  food toys are not chew toys  if it says on the package  not to leave dog unattended and it is not a chew toy  do your pet a favor and follow the directions <br  ><br  >my 3 stars is not because i did not like it  i bought 4 of them all together  it is a design issue  i want to see a way to close off the opening so the kibble does not fall out so easily  that is all 
product	this time the meds did not work and one package was empty the rest almost nothing in them had to go to vet here and get it 
product	my dogs love pill pockets  it makes giving them pills easy  i have tried several different flavors   the dogs like them all  i they all have a strong odor but most of the flavors smell palatable  the duck and pea flavor smells disgusting  the dogs love it  but i almost gag every time if open the bag  i usually buy the least expensive flavor  but i will not buy this flavor again 
quality	these are really hard   sharp  they do not soften when soaked in boiling water  i did not think they were even safe for my pugs to eat because the bits are like shattered plastic  my pugs are no sissies  they eat raw bones  not just the meat  the actual bone    antler all the time  if you have a dog who could chew glass   not bat an eye  these might work for you <br  >as for me  i finally put them through a spice grinder   turned them into a fine powder   used as a food addition just so i could get my moneys worth 
product	bought this and a bag of brown s cockatiel food  i was sent the right packaging but upon looking at the   34 feed  34  it is not what comes for this product  both the cockatiel food and hamster food was both different than whats pictured  it looks like it was bagged incorrectly by the manufacturer  customer service was a  on replacing the product 
quality	my puppy really preferred the rawhide  so it is just a personal preference for my dog  i do not know why she did not care for it  but it was not for her  she just left it  i am sure it is   34 my dog  34   because the idea of the product is wonderful 
health	this made my cat throw up so i will not be ordering it anymore  he has a sensitive stomach so it might work for other cats 
health	1  they crumbled into dangerous shards when chewed by my dog<br  >2  they caused her to have   34 pudding poo  34 <br  ><br  >i ll stick with the himalayan chews
product	was this labeled discount dented can special somewhere and i missed it  every can in this package  even the one s in the middle of the pallet  were dented  there were even 2 cans that were burst open  they were that mishandled  sadly  i am ordering from amazon to save me time and energy  so i did not find the time to return this terribly damaged item 
product	i bought these to keep my anxious rescue dog occupied instead of using my furniture and clothes to get his chewing out  i bought the weight appropriate size according to manufacturer recommendations  i gave him a treat and then went to my car  i had forgotten something so i ran back inside 2 minutes later and the chew was gone  i figured that he lost it under a counter or something  when i came back i gave him another one and to my surprise he finished it in approx 20 30 seconds  he just bites right through them like they were biscuits  totally disappointed i figured that i would put them away and try to return them  i leave for another 20 minutes and he located the bag and eats 14 more treats in those 20 minutes  so while he clearly enjoys the taste  these are not chews by any stretch of the imagination  i am sure he received 0 tooth care effects due to the fact that he just bit them into pieces with no effort at all  a total bust of a product for my needs 
quality	this is the only kong stuff food that both my dogs refuse to eat  after a day it becomes brown  clumpy  gross  and hard to remove from the kong  avoid this item   
product	i can only tell you that this product was a total disappointment to me   three things stood out the most about this product that made it a very poor purchase for me   first the smell is overwhelming and not in a good way and it lingers on and on   second there were large pieces of something in the cream itself and not just a few on them but all through the product   no one would want to apply these chunks of whatever they were to your pets skin or any other part of him for that matter   and third and probably the worst aspect of this product was that within a few hours it dries into a plaster like substance that is very painful for the cat making every movement tourture for him   i ended up washing this stuff  for lack of a more discriptive word   off my cat the following day and it was a huge relief for him   i can only recommend that no one buy this stuff to put on their cat and my two jars of it went right into the trash making this a very expensive mistake for me and my cat  
health	i have bought other types of nature s variety cat food before  and they were fine  last week i decided to switch to the limited ingredient formula because of its supposedly healthy content  my cat started choking on this food  so i checked the container and noticed that there were pieces of bone  some of them looked like bone shavings  and they were rather soft  however  there were few bigger pieces  about 1 4 of inch  that were very sharp  unacceptable 
product	the texture is not as smooth as the more expensive brand  my dog does not seem to mind the texture though 
health	i discarded these treats after seeing news stories about dogs sickened by   34 chicken jerky  34  products made in china  i strongly suggest that amazon com remove all of these products from their site for the time being  for several years now pet owners have been reporting both sickness and death tied to chicken jerky treats made in china  since the problem has been around for a few years  i will not buy any variety of chinese chicken jerky treats for my dogs  note  you really have to read the   34 small print  34  on most of these packages to find whether or not they are   34 made in china  34

quality	does the job  but smells horrible  the peanut butter and chicken flavors are much easier on the nose  but of course my dog loved them 
quality	picky dog did not care for these had to give them away to dog that was considerable larger and was not so picky
quality	my dog did not like these  he just will not eat them and he loves the flavor from a different brand  unfortunately for me  it was a wasted purchase 
product	disappointing   most of my dogs were not too interested in it  but it was highly recommended by a friend  and her dog loved it 
health	have tried this product  same bottle  on 2 different ear infections now and no success  my poor girl still has an ear infection after using for almost 2 weeks  so off to the vet we go 
quality	i am totally dissatisfied in this product  the brand is great and shipment was fast  but when i got the product in hand they were dried up and in crumbs  no longer treats but now could be classified has dust to sprinkle on regular dog food  my puppy loves them but he will not get any part of this  i will send them back and will never do business with these people again  this product had to have been on the shelf for years in order to get this dried out where they just turned to dust  they took advantage of me and this will not happen again  i will not recommend this company and amazon needs to shut them down 
health	this product came promptly and was what i ordered  however  after giving this supplement to my dog he began to get sick and repeatedly vomited over the course of a week  i gave this supplement to him according to the recommendation of my vet who said i should be giving him milk thistle to help the functioning of his liver  after taking him back to the vet and showing her this product  she believed that he was having a reaction to the extra ingredients in this supplement  i have switched my dog to a milk thistle supplement that has no other ingredients and he has not had any other problems  so i tend to believe that this supplement was causing the problem <br  >i believe this supplement may work for other dogs  but it did not for mine  if you are considering this product  please be aware that your dog may also be sensitive to the artificial flavorings in this product 
quality	my dog does not like this treat  i am giving it to the goodwill and hopefully another dog will enjoy them <br  >it is fairly prices for a liver treat  maybe my dog it too fussy   
quality	i had to stop buying this because my cats do not like it  i think it is stinky  too  i like this product in the sliced beef  and the cats lone that  but will not eat this one  too bad  i thought it would be good for them despite the smell 
product	do not buy these  this is a rip off  it comes with 6 treats that any dog could eat in 3 minutes  never buying again   20 for 6 mini snicker size dog treats
product	killed literally everything in the tank except the parasites  fish  snails  and plants all dead within a week  never buying this product again 
product	i never felt these were working so i stopped using them and bought revolution from my vet instead  it was a lot more expensive but they worked while these may or may not have worked with time <br  >i would not buy this product again 
health	since they are chewy and soft  i am sneaking 2 into their  special diet  wet food each day  i checked with the company website for the right portion  the ingredients are stellar and i want to be proactive re  urinary tract health with my male cats  i will not re purchase though 
quality	purchased this food  believing it had large bits of food instead of the tiny pieces of colored crap i would found in the pet store    not    it has some large pieces but the bag i received was filled almost halfway with tiny pieces of seeds and particles my hamster will not eat  only some of the food in the bag is as pictured 
product	these are so expensive that we joke they are made of shredded money  they also do not seem to do a thing for my dog s teeth but they do freshen his breath  we mostly buy them because there is nothing out there that my dog loves as much  he will do anything for a greenie 
quality	this is one of the best dog foods we have ever fed our dachshund but it is pricey compared to others and the worst problem is that your dog will start to smell like fritos   yes  fritos  and i mean a very strong odor  at first we could not figure it out but we accidentally ran out a month ago and purchased a rachel ray product that is grain free   and you guessed it  within a few days no more fritos odor   gone  kaput   nothing  so while it does keep her coat nice and she likes it and i am sure the quality is good overall  it will very likely make your dog stink   unless of course you like fritos 
product	with 18 kitties  i am always getting some treat or other    sadly this one did not go over very well <br  ><br  >as usual they all came running when the   34 bag shake  34  sound was heard    but almost all of them only had one or two before walking away  leaving the rest for the dogs to clean up   <br  ><br  >this is a first    such a   34 mass  34  dislike of an item  other pounce flavors have been well received    but not this one  we are talking   18   not just one or two kitties    since i am not the one eating them  all i can do is report my observation    i opened a different brand   tossed them on the floor  and they were readily eaten    once again  leaving the pouncetartar control uneaten <br  ><br  >as stated  the dogs love  em    but i did not buy them for the dogs   
product	purchased this for cat with hair loss from itching suspected mites as he<br  >had no fleas and was treated in past with flea product  this product<br  >reduced itching and helped heal hair loss spots  only problem the cats<br  >hate the order and try to lick it off  also  hard to put on where there is<br  >fur growing   so does not really get down to the skin  unless a bald spot  
quality	my boys did not care for these treats  they are a bit spoiled by natural balance treat roll and fresh cooked liver 
product	total crap  i ordered this rather than getting it from my vet as i normally do  figuring i would save a few bucks  i have used it for two months now and my dogs never stopped scratching  the brand i would get from my vet eliminated the scratching completely  very disappointing   big waste of    
health	this product is manufactured in china  my dog loves these treats but i need to find some made in the usa  the product is making dogs sick  i returned them once i saw made in china  people need to stop giving these to their dogs  i do wish they stated this in the description  i never would have purchased them  62 
quality	would rather have a product made in the usa especially with the scare and recall of chicken jerky made in china 
product	i used this for 2 months on a daily basis and it did not get rid of the two 1 4 square inch fungus spots on my pleco  i have had much better results with api pimafix  my fish had two whitish spots that were slightly indented with a fairly noticable coating of white on the spots  the pimafix rapidly cleared it up the white  and the normal color is returning after 2 weeks of use 
quality	well  i hate to rate things lower because of our experience  but i am giving it three stars <br  >if the cats were rating this food  it would be a 1 <br  ><br  >we d never tried this brand before and have not seen it locally  since we like to give our cats variety in their<br  >foods  just like they like variety too  i gave this one a shot  i think the tiki brand only uses fish flavored<br  >ingredients in their foods <br  ><br  >now  our cats are not huge fish flavored food fans  still  i thought this would be a nice change <br  >i have to say that i think the quality of the food seems to be top notch  i did not see any mysterious food<br  >in the cans  and in fact  looked a little similar to what you would see opening a tin of human food sardines <br  >it comes in a golden aspic  and there are visible chunks of sardines <br  ><br  >i did not give the cats any treats  dry food  snacks  etc all afternoon so they would be really hungry<br  >for dinner  this has always worked as a way to get them to try something new <br  >i warmed up the can  i always warm their cans in hot water for extra scent and taste  and divided it between them <br  >our male cat dived right in  our female sniffed the bowl  looked at me like i was trying to poison her <br  >and ran out of the room  she simply refused to even consider eating this food <br  ><br  >i would not give her anything else  despite pestering me for a couple hours because she was hungry <br  >nope  she would rather starve than to touch this one  it was still in her dish the next morning  with only<br  >the gravy having been licked off by the male  who also never finished his food either <br  ><br  >we ended up flushing the rest of the food in their dishes  soaking them to get the sardine scent out <br  >and going back to their preferred poultry for dinner  i now have 11 expensive cans of food left  i predict<br  >the kitty in the storage area near us will be eating quite well in the next few weeks <br  ><br  >in conclusion  if your cat is already a big seafood fish flavor fan  then they will probably love this one <br  >the quality is there  the food is fresh smelling  albeit cat stinky   and not full of fillers <br  >if your cat is not a big seafood fan  then you might as well not bother r cat is already a big seafood fish flavor fan  then they will probably love this one <br  >the quality is there  the food is fresh smelling  albeit cat stinky   and not full of fillers <br  >if your cat is not a big seafood fan  then you might as well not bother 
health	not sure if it is the allergy formula or what but these are not as maleable as the regular pill pockets  so my dog ended up spitting out several pills  the regular pill pockets are awesome but this formula is only so so  and they smell super gross 
quality	still worried that with all the recalls from products made in china  including this chinese product  even though not on recall list i plan on buying made in usa fro now on   for my dog s safety 
quality	would rather have a product made in the usa especially with the scare and recall of chicken jerky made in china 
product	they are overpriced and do not work with many cats  there are less expensive more effective options available if you are creative 
quality	arrived damaged  rotten food dripping out  and stinking  what a waste of money  my dogs would not have anything to do with the food 
health	had a serious flea infestation and this was one of the efforts to fix it  that being said  it is okay   hard to evaluate it as it was a serious problem and it might not be a fair evaluation  in addition i used two oral agents  capstar once a week and a monthly pill  after 6 weeks i am finally seeing results 
quality	barney liked it while in training but does not like it now  what else can i say barney did not like it 
product	wanted to use these as training rewards  but was very disappointed in texture  half the bag was crumbs  i will not purchase again 
product	this product was not a good buy at all  all the pieces came broken and very small and was not worth the price  will never order this again 
product	this dogfood is rated only one star out of five on dogfoodadvisor com  maybe that is why it was not expensive 
product	this product is certainly not worth the price of purchase  all product was made up to broken bits and pieces  stop offering this product 
quality	these are on the recall list  very scary because i only want to feed my dogs pure food  too bad 
product	my dog did not really care much for these  i gave one to my dog and my mom s    they stayed untouched on the floor for days then finally it got eaten  the rest of the bag got tossed  my dog is picky so maybe other dogs would like them better  i would not get them again though
product	one case of the food had 19 dented cans out of 24  apparently i was sent a damaged case of food  unacceptable  
product	first problem was delivery took over a month and no communication from seller  secondly  we have been using the daily flea killer and the long term once a month flea killer  it has not helped with the fleas  at all  the house  the linens  pet beds  toys  etc have been cleaned thoroughly at least 3 times  yard is treated regularly <br  ><br  >going to go back to using the trifexis for our dogs  we have one dog who is very allergic to the saliva of the flea bite and needless to say she has been miserable and so have we  in trying to help  it is the only product that has worked very effectively  i was hoping we could find an alternative that was a bit cheaper  never again <br  ><br  >all in all  i would not recommend this product  even though having done my due diligence on researching various products  i thought the capstar would help  it hasn t  not our cats or our dogs and our cats are exclusively inside cats and have never had fleas until now <br  ><br  >i most definitely would not recommend this seller  if you do want to try this product buy it elsewhere 
product	i was hoping i could replace the more expensive stuff that i was buying from the vet but this just did not work for my dog s ears 
product	not so good  dogs did not like them very much  my italian greyhound would eventually eat them  but my chihuahua absolutley detested them  i will not buy these again 
product	product was made in china  you would think with being american kennel club it would have been manufacturd in the usa
health	beware of this product  i applied to my pug last sunday and some red bumps appeared on my dog now it is infected and i have to take him to the veterinary
product	be warned   this item is not three modules as shown but only one  as for the game itself  it is a cute idea  but dogs do not deal with delayed gratification well   at least mine doesn t  she figured out the trick for one treat compartment and then promptly figured out that you could get all of the treats out by just turning the whole game upside down  if this were indeed three modules  i would say that the  20 ish dollar price tag might be warranted  if you have a dog that cannot destroy the game in seconds   but since it is only 1 module and plastic at that  it is not worth this price  finally  if you want to use this with a large dog  mine is a german shepherd   you really need to stay with your dog while playing with the toy  even then  because the base is relatively small  it is hard to hold onto the game while your dog uses its paws and or teeth to get at the treat compartments  this can be painful with a hyper  food motivated dog like mine  my dog got bored with the game once she figured out that she could just dump it over to get the treats  at that point she ran off into another room with it  when i went in to retrieve the game a few minutes later  she had one corner of the base and one treat module completely chewed up  two of the rubber feet extracted from the base  and the holder that keeps the rotating top in place chewed off  this is definitely not a durable game for larger dogs 
quality	the treats are a perfect size for a small dog  however my small dog will not eat them  my big dog does like them but she eats anything 
health	my dog loves these treats  however  she got sick a while back and we took her to our vet  two shots  special food  and a couple of hundred dollars later she was back to normal  we never really figured out what made her sick  then i heard about the jerky from china making some pets sick and some died  the symptoms listed for the jerky treat illnesses were the same symptoms our pet displayed when she was sick  i cannot say for sure that these treats made her sick  but i am not taking any more chances  i will not buy treats from china again and i do not recommend these treats  by the way  they are incorrectly listed on amazon s site as being made in the u s 
product	product is nearing expiration date <br  ><br  >i have taken screenshots of this listing and contacted amz <br  ><br  >the listing says product weighs 10 8 pounds and is delivered in pack of 12<br  ><br  >this would lead any reasonable person to believe that the delivery would include at least 4 5 boxes since each pack weighs 36 oz <br  ><br  >instead i received just 1 box  
product	so i gave this product a 3 because i would say that the water dispenser is a 5 and works great  my cats like it  it lasts a long time  is easy to fill  and easy to clean <br  ><br  >however  the food dispenser is a 2 at best  the food does not flow easily out if it  and once the food that is in the bowl is eaten you have to poke at the opening to get any more to come out  which my cats do not know how to do  thus it is useless for leaving them for the weekend 
product	caution  per ingredient list on back of package  the 2nd ingredient is chicken  this is not stated in the product description on amazon  this is an issue for dogs like mine who are highly allergic to chicken  i gave treats away  not worth shipping back 
product	these treats are made in china  they have the same exact label as the smaller bag which are made in the usa   i did not know this when i ordered them  it is deceptive on the part of the manufacturer  i will never buy another smokehouse product again 
quality	poor quality litter  does not contain odors  and seems to have decreased in quality over the years  i switched to a new litter 
product	the greenies were not in a canister  which is very misleading  the greenies arrived in two zip top bags  i really wanted the canister as a better alternative to having bags everywhere  despite the packaging  my dog loves them 
product	my 6 month old lab ate these in under 10 seconds  in my opinion they are overpriced and did not see much results
quality	the individual pieces were very hard and the cats left many of the treats   something the never do  too hard for their taste 
product	my 45 lb dog loves these but they literally only took her a few minutes to eat  disappointing for both of us 
product	we bought one of these at pets mart and our dog loved it  what a great idea  we bought this 3 pack on amazon as our original bottle was about empty  on two of the three bottles the balls do not spin and therefor do not work  you cannot take the top off and pour the juice in another unit so they are trash <br  ><br  >while a great product i doubt i will gamble on the shoddy quality of the delivery system in the future  too bad for all concerned  
product	this is nothing like what was pictured  that is false advertisement  i want my money back   but no    i refuse to pay the gas  i live in a very small town the nearest ups store is 2 hours away   do not buy 
health	warning on news about chicken jerky treats made in china <br  >said it was killing some dogs and making others sick 
product	used to be moist and easily pliable  my recent purchase was completely disappointing  the pockets were flaky and dry and it was not easy to conceal the pill meantfor my cat 
quality	one quarter of bag was a powdered yellow filler that the bird would not touch  he kept throwing his dish on the floor and would squawk at me when i entered his room like he was angry with me that i fed him this crap  i have had this macaw for 35 years and we have a good bond  he communicates to me what he likes and does not like  this includes how he feels about certain family members  i had hoped this food would work out because it is available in a 14 5 pound bag so it is a little cheaper by the pound  but  i guess you get what you pay for  a bunch of filler 
health	i have bought three of these  and my experience has been pretty consistent  my dogs really go nuts for this bone  however  if i leave them to it for more than about 10 minutes  they will follow up the next day with diarrhea and or really bright yellow poop that smells just awful <br  ><br  >anyway  if i limit their time  or after they have worked off most of the loose stuff  it seems like a good product  they are usually not that interested in bones  but they really like this one <br  ><br  >i m probably not buying any more of them  as there is plenty of tasty things out there that do not have negative side effects <br  ><br  >hope it helps you 
product	very surprised to see that this product was  made in china   480 dogs already died from all jerky made in china <br  >hundreds more reported intestinal bleeding and other problems years later <br  >please remove this product and a big boo out to dogswell for importing this product  never will i buy or recommend this company to any friend or family 
product	i was very excited to get this product because its low price  unfortunately i am very sad that it does not work whatsoever  we follow the instructions precisely  but nothing  waste of money 
quality	my chickens usually love this type of food but they would not eat this order of encore  every time i serve it up they just walk away  to see if it was stale or off in some way  i went to the store and bought another brand that looks identical and they eat it right up  i wish i had not ordered two bags 
product	i thought i would ordered the same thing i would purchased at the store   it looks it in the photo anyway~~when i got my order  i was disappointed as the   34 pops  34  were only half the size i was expecting also they were poorly made  the   34 stick  34  fell out almost immediately and the pops fell apart~~my puppy liked the taste but the mess was not worth it~~
quality	my cat devoured each flavor the first few days and then she would not touch them again  cats can be like that though  at least they are not made in china  so your cat will not die from eating them  they are made in tennessee  usa  now i have another cat so i will see how she likes them  all organic and that is great  you know your kitty is getting a good for her treat 
health	these bones are terrible  they splinter and break apart into little pieces so the dogs can choke  will never buy these again 
health	it is cat food  my cat likes it but he is not generally picky  he does not get any hairballs though so that is something 
health	i ordered the advantage ii flea treatment online because i wanted to save a little money compared to the price you pay at the vet  the  150 in vet bills i paid for an iv and hospitalization for my cat after she must have ingested some of it made it definitely not worth it  i would recommend looking into a less chemically oriented flea treatment if at all possible 
product	i ordered this product on september 20th  so  when the ad asks if you want the product tomorrow  do not be fooled  i have amazon prime  you know  the 2 day delivery  and yes  it says this product comes from amazon  still no sign of it  if you need this product within the next month  you would be better off shopping somewhere else  this is very disappointing <br  ><br  >i purchased this product elsewhere  and it is great  please do not confuse my disappointment with amazon with the quality of this real meat product <br  ><br  >follow up<br  >after writing this negative review  my order simply disappeared from my orders list with amazon  it turns out they did not actually have the product  but did not figure that out within the 5 1 2 weeks following the order placement  upon contacting amazon i was offered 1 day shipping to compensate for the inconvenience    after further discussion  they agreed to send me the product for free  with expedited shipping  we shall see 
quality	thought this was going to work great after reading all the positive reviews  but      i knew my cats and dog would never take the capsule by mouth  so i emptied the capsule in their canned food  not one of them  even the dog  went near their food  there must be something wrong if a dog will not eat it  i returned the product for a refund 
quality	i could not get them down their throat or on food  they just would not touch them  maybe if a treat was made instead of capsule 
product	i have one indoor cat and three feral cats that i feed and all though all of them like this product  i found that they were eating more of it  about 1 3 more  than the nutro natural that i had been feeding them and they still seemed hungry  it was a last minute buy because i was not able to purchase the nutro natural at my other store  i will not buy it again 
quality	i purchased this product thinking that it would provide some vitamin c  when i read the ingredients  i was somewhat horrified that the ingredients listed on the package have sugar as number one followed by   34 milk and milk derivatives  34   furthermore  according to the package  there is only 4  fruit    needless to say  my piggies hated this  since guinea pigs should not eat sugar and do not eat dairy products  their rejection was fine with me  the treat they do like is the oxbow simple rewards veggie treats   which lists barley flour as its primary ingredient followed by alfalfa meal  the rest of the ingredients are primarily dried vegetables  my piggies adore this treat and will stand up squeaking in excitement when they see hear the package 
product	if amazon prides itself on high quality merchandise  they need to stop selling dog treats from china  an article came out this week  october 2013  stating the many dogs that have died or become ill from these products  on the other hand  amazon is advertising this products as being made in the usa  there is no way to know that they are made in china until after delivery 
quality	i have 6 cats  only one of them liked this food  my oldest girl  the rest of them just did not want to eat it  they were pathetic begging for anything else  i hate it  this is a great price and a lot of food  and i like that the indoor formulas keep their poop from stinking so bad   am i the only one that notices this  <br  >the bag i got was fresh  and well sealed  they have ate other friskies before and liked it   they love  ocean fish  flavor   so i think they just did not like this particular kind  i told them all they would just have to starve if they would not eat it because we are all having to cut back on expenses  including them  they decided to try to hunger strike  my male cat acted like he was going to go insane if he could not get a pomegranate seed  i felt bad they were so obviously hungry  i went and got them some cheap generic food that i know they like and mixed with it  they are eating it now but still trying to pick around this kind <br  >i cannot rate it bad because the food seems fine   it is got good nutrition and i trust purina  my cats are just picky and spoiled 
health	my poor dog got sick   he never  and i mean never  defecated in my home  and not once  but twice  he received one a day and appeared to love them  after the third day  he had a bad case of diarrhea and was vomiting  it went on for two days  i have given him chicken strips in the past but not by this manufacturer  i threw them away immediately  i am sticking to homemade treats from now on 
product	i wish i had known these are from china because i would have never bought  i will never buy hartz products again  i am just sorry that i gave my riley one of them before thinking to read the package  it is getting harder and harder to know whether any of the ingredients are from china so i know we are fighting a losing battle but for this package   i am throwing it away 
quality	this bag of hay was all dried out and i had to return it to the store  animals would not eat itcause of this reason
product	the pieces are very small and not really a good snack item  my dog loved them  but i would not buy them again 
product	i had called your customer service the day the order arrived  i had been buying the next size smaller package for some time  made in the usa  the smaller package  i found this larger size and ordered it  wnen it arrive i saw it came form china  i never buy anything from communist china or any other communist country  they should mark the package that is from china just a note i thru out two  2  complete containers into the trash 
product	i liked this pouch  but after a month or so of use  the   34 carabiner  34  clip is pretty much useless  also the connector that ties the drawstring together came out  and we had to tie it and then melt it back together so the drawstring would still work  the belt clip part works just fine  so that is what i am mostly using now  the front pouch is a nice addition  but we use it to hold the dog s training clicker instead of bags  for the price  it is not bad  but the quality was not as awesome as i would have hoped 
quality	good idea  but my dog just was not interested  weird because his life is food  he just got bored trying to get the food out even on the easy setting  plus  it kept getting pushed underneath the couch or behind furniture by him trying to get the food out <br  ><br  >it is not in use now 
quality	the recipe has change since i purchased them 1 1 2 years ago when they went moldy fast  2 of my dogs now will not eat them 
product	i like this product because my dog likes it  but do not be fooled by the online photo of four packages for  13  it is only one package  which means it costs twice as much as the others available  i should have known since it says the list price is over  100  do not be fooled like i was 
quality	i tried the ice cube method  i tried just dropping it in by the scoop  but no matter what    my beta would not eat it  i am going to have to go with the flakes  i guess  i really wish he would have  his color needs to be enhanced  however  it does stay in the water column as people have stated  i might try soaking his regular nuggets in the brine  and dropping them in that way    maybe he will get some of the brine  then 
quality	i only say what my guinea pigs tell me and they say this is crap  i think they would choose death from starvation before eating this  i am waiting for a special order of their favorite pellets from amazon and i thought this would hold them until it came in  this is pale in color and must taste bad as they will not touch it  if your pigs are fat and too healthy buy this to remedy that  if you want a great product order     oxbow cavy cuisine       firm pellets  dark green and your pets will love them  unfortunately oxbow is expensive  i found a 10lb  bag here on amazon for the same price as the 5lb  bag also found here on amazon but the delivery is way long and they may just cancel the order as they have with another awesome deal i had with them  i will be pissed if they do 
product	the chews were delivered promptly and well packaged  both dogs like the chews  however they devoured them in minutes  for the price  these are not economical  i have found other chews  from the same company  that the dogs like just as well for a fraction of the price 
product	halo chicken treat was too expensive  then i found this one <br  >it was good quality   great price <br  >last 2 months  everytime i got this treat  the quality s been terrible <br  >a lot of pieces were not even freezed dried  hard to chew  my cats <br  >am i just having a bad luck  or you do not care about the quality of product 
quality	seller sent the one for dogs only and not the chicken raw bites described here for cats and dogs  the bag i have only mentions dogs and has a picture of a dog  not the picture shown here with both animals   if you have a cat  please check the bag when the order arrives  my cat devours the mini raw bites and i was hoping to save some money by buying this bigger bag  i looked at the ingredients and i cannot tell if there is anything in there a cat should not eat  i did give it to my cat because the ingredients look okay  but he does not like it as much as the mini raw bites so i do not know what the difference is  if someone knows if it is the same then i will modify my rating 
quality	y cats refused to eat this even though it is good for them  i mixed it with their regular cat food but they would not touch it  i will try again later with less of the wysong 
product	i don nt know what else to say  i fed him  indoor cat  the pills in wed dry food and made sure he ate it  went through the whole package and he still has some fleas left 
health	my dog vomited after eating  he will not eat the again  they have a yellow powder on them  a little thick for a small dog 
quality	i have used purina for many many years    34 must be the puppy chow  34   but now with recent recalls  i have gone to using science diet
quality	maybe mine are picky  but my rabbits refused to eat this  it is just timothy pellets  nothing else  which is not a great diet for rabbits 
product	i thought these would be like the ones at costco  unfortunately  they were not  severely inconsistent widths in the same package  some were like tooth picks and others regulsr stick size like half inch  they smell the same and appear to be composed of the same material  dogs still really like them 
product	not quite as tough  the dogs soon began tearing it apart  a bit disappointing and it will not last long here with our rottweilers 
product	the bag was almost empty   meaning  only about 10 little treats inside  i was intrigued by the name of the snack  but am very disappointed 
quality	i have 5 cats and they were not interested in it   they picked at it eating just a few pieces 
quality	i thought my cats would enjoy this  but they will not eat it  sorry  i wasted my money i ll have to throw it out 
product	i used this exactly as directed and out of my 3 cats  2 are still scratching terribly and i still see flea dirt on them  it appeared to work on the other cat  i treated them about 2 weeks ago  very disappointed in the results  all three cats are around 8 10 lbs
health	i have purchased these greenines several times and have not had a problem  however  the last purchase resulted in my dog throwing up each time we gave her a greenie  this happened six times and we finally discarded the remaining greenies  i am cautious of ordering them again 
quality	these pill pockets hide the meds and seem to taste great to the dog but they stink like a dead duck  while i would recommend using pill pockets to get your dog to take meds  i would not recommend this particular flavor for the sake of the humans living in the house 
product	i found this ball to be pretty disappointing  my other similar balls engage my smart one for hours  but the weighted aspect of this ball makes it far more difficult to roll across the room  my obsessive terrier who loves a challenge just gets irritated with this ball  as he noses it and it does not necessarily go anywhere  perhaps lighter treats would make it a smoother roll  but i like to put kibbles in my puzzles for breakfast and engagement while i am out  this was not a good fit for the kibble weight 
product	update 8 30 16  would not buy this again  i have now been feeding my buddy fancy feast seafood assortment  he eats all of it and it seems to have very good ingredients  and a grain free dry food  there are rarely leftovers  unlike with friskies  there were always leftovers and he really did not goble this food the way he goobles the fancy feast   i m assuming there is a good reason why this food is nearly 4 times less expensive than the fancy feast  and only my cat knows why  i think if you are on a budget and or buying food for a animal shelter or providing food for strays that might normally starve  friskies is a good alternative  to providing nothing   but i would not give this to my family member   <br  ><br  >original review  what can i say other than he eats it if he gets hungry but i almost always see leftovers when i leave it out all day  so he is not particularly in love with this  a lot of vets seem to now recommend not leaving pet food out all day  because if they are indoor cats and not very active  they can get quite fat   but instead establishing feeding times  in morning when you get up  early evening when you get home and then just before you go to bed  then you put the food away after 1 2 hour out each time  <br  ><br  >anyway  after i run out of this  i will end up doing what some animal specialists recommend  and that means mixing a high quality grain free canned and bagged dry cat food  that has real meat and fish as the primary ingredients and not rice   they also suggest mashing in steamed veggies  broccoli  carrots  zucchini  and some leftover meat or fish i have for myself  chicken  steak  salmon   but we will see how long i can keep that up 
product	why would anyone ship an open bag of dog food with a feeble attempt at sealing it with packaging tape  sorry    i do not get this at all  
quality	the cats do not like it <br  >they do not like this flavor <br  >it is a waste to give it to them 
product	all 3 cats tell me it is unfit for kitty consumption  i do not know why  there was no problem with delivery  food looks attractive on plates  cats are most likely just trying to drive me to an early grave
product	in the past my cats have happily eaten this  this time it is a big no thanks lady  so divided on how to rank it  delivery and all that was fine  appearance on the plate and a  will they eat it  uh no 
quality	my dog would not touch it  wasted money       he smelled it and walked away  i tried putting food on it and he licked food off and then would not touch it 
health	but do not send anymore as it is not working very well for my dogs upset stomach and i refuse to deal with vomit
product	i should have read the total weight of the material inside  when it arrived in the mail i was very disappointed  these two products together are about the size of a bar of soap 
product	this dog bone container was a waste of time  money and postage  it is no better than an empty plastic mayonnaise jar  which it reminds me of   we bought this to replace a nice ceramic cookie jar we used for dog treats and were terribly disappointed  it is all plastic and the plastic lid clicks into place with a cheap feel  it may be air tight but do not count on it  do not waste your money 
quality	total waste of money for us   our dog will not eat this treat  he spits it out  we buy the fromm s dof food and he loves it  but we have tried 3 different flavours of their treats and he will not eat any of them  they are on the expensive side so we will not buy anymore
quality	giving the item 3 stars because i do not like giving my cats treats containing all sorts of ingredients  they eat premium canned and dry food and freeze dried chicken bits for treats  however  my boys enjoy this  guess like some humans preferences preservatives and other stuff makes food more tasty  so once in awhile i let the cats have their way  they are 14 yrs old and at this stage of their life i want them to be happy and not deprive them of what they enjoy  they like this item and i do not want them having to beg for it  so as a weakened \\ mother\\  i give in 
quality	these bones were awful  the inside of the bone had some gooey substance which smelled horrible and got all over my dog and his bed  i ended up throwing them away because i could not handle the mess they caused 
health	my vet recommended this for my 8 pound dog who keeps having bloody stool  after a couple of rounds of antibiotics it would come back  he has been on fortiflora for 3 weeks and it seems to be getting better  his stool is not as bloody  however  it should have worked after 1 week  i am going to order another box to continue him on it and hope it gets his digestive system to work properly  if so  i will give it a 4 star 
product	was not quite as durable as i expected  leg was torn off the first night  though the dogs still want to play with the rest of it  it is been taken away  of course   but rather disappointed in this product 
quality	the bag contains all hard  broken pieces  like the bottom of the barrel was scraped for this bag  very diasppointed  it is so hard the pets will not eat it  what a waste of my money  i get this product every month but now i need to reconsider and possibly seek other options  whole life has nerve sending out such crap  someone should take the time to inspect the products they are sending 
quality	well  this is really not to deter people away from this product  the only reason why i am giving 1 star is because my dog does not like it at all 
quality	i have three active small dogs to entertain  i thought this kong wobbler treat dispensing dog toy would be a fun challenge for them  wrong  they have no interest in it at all 
product	my dogs love the product <br  >not sure if the product does help their teeth but the next visit to the vet should tell the story <br  ><br  >i was very disappointed when the product came and a good may treats were smashed so i did not get my money s worth <br  >the company needs to find a better way to ship the product 
health	i just gotta say that this does not work  my cat still hacks atleast 1 2 hairballs a week  so spend the money on some hairball meds and not on this  its a good food for them  just does not do what its supposed to  so just buy the regular it wont make a difference 
health	fed just one of these to my dog and she had several bouts of diarrhea and rectal bleeding  i then discovered there have been many others have had similar or much worse experiences 
product	i trust thus brand and my dogs love this treat  it is a little pricey but when on sale it is a great treat 
product	just like the first reviewer i too thought these were full pig ears just by the title and the photo  obviously it was my fault for not reading the description or the image better  right on the package it says slivers  smokehouse needs to change the product title to 10 pack pig ear slivers dog treat  i have a large dog and she eats these in one bite  these are not worth  10 00  maybe  4 50  if you are looking for full size pig ears you may want to skip this item 
quality	i am not very happy this time  many pieces were already dry and not fresh  disappointed  usually whole life provided fresh treats and the other 2 packs of salmon were not edible    very dry  
product	totally not what is pictured    i would not have spent this much for what i received  18 pcs the size of a cookie  this will not last 30 seconds with my chewer <br  >i guess the name medallions literally meant medallion size treats  not worth it 
product	it was great to get it in the package and was fresh for the dog loved it  but i have been to the stores and have found the same individual cans to be less expensive 
product	i wanted to try another flavor for my boys  as i thought they would like to change it up a little since they are on a special diet to begin with  but when we received these  i was disappointed  because the bag does not show the chunks like in the picture  the bag is just full of crumbs  in order to give this to the cats  i will need to put in their food dishes  and there is just no      treat  to it  my boys do not particularly care for this flavor  but the other cats in the house do  so they will not go to waste 
product	advantix ii does a good job at getting rid of fleas  it is also promoted for repelling mosquitos  which is why i chose it over other  less expensive and equally effective flea control products for the dog i dog sit  aka jedi   i found it stunningly underimpressive at repelling mosquitos  jedi has such short hair that if he ever actually got a flea  i could flick it off with my finger  all that skin makes him irresistable to mosquitos  before i applied the product  swarms of mosquitos would land on him and he would go crazy biting himself  after i applied the product  it was no different  i kept waiting for it to get better  but it never did  so now it is been a month and it is time to reapply  i am going to finish using this order then go back to a cheaper flea control alternative  i will use the difference to buy more flys off spray  which really does repel the swarms  three stars for this average flea control product 
quality	these were dried up and crumbling plus they smelled bad  the experation date was 2015  nylabone is a good name but there is a problem with all their dental chews  i bought 3 different flavors and all were bad  i checked at another store and they looked bad also 
health	i have had no obvious problems with this product on my 110 pound newfoundland but         my 11 pound chihauhau mix did not do well  i live an hour from lyme ct and really need to take lyme disease seriously since all my dogs and friends have all gotten it <br  >this month i have finally decided to get rid of all of the advantic products in my home and change over to the new german developed flea and tick collar called  seresto  check it out  it has great reviews and lasts for up to 8 months which makes it cheaper then monthly drops 
product	my dog loves these usually  had previously purchased at dog classes  apparently these were a bad batch or just hung around the warehouse too long  i could see many pieces were white instead of yellow and some had black spots  was looking through clear plastic portion and fortunately did not open the bag  i hope they went into the garbage and not back on the shelf <br  ><br  >returned to amazon without any problems 
quality	my dogs love the chicken vitality treats and they love duck chews so i thought i would try these  these have a very strong smell and my dogs will not eat them  my dogs are very picky but my neighbors dog seems to like them 
health	frontline plus does not appear to be working this year  my dog was completely infested with fleas the third week of the month  she is not an outdoor dog  yorkie   5lbs  she was treated with frontline plus less than two weeks ago and yet i found 8 10 fleas on her yesterday <br  ><br  >i guess i am going to have to get her to the vet and see about a prescription medication 
product	in one package there was 8 cans out of 24  spoiled there my costs increased and i didn`t get the amount i paid for
product	greenies vs minties  <br  ><br  >cost is about the same   greenies might be a little more expensive<br  >quality   no difference to my dog   chews either one up in a few minutes  ok a minute <br  >delivery   bought enough other dog treats so delivery was free making on line purchase more convenient<br  ><br  >other   only good thing seemed like you get a few more greenies then minties in the same size box  minties my dog s breath was much more pleasant
quality	product was stale old very disappointed in this one received you need to make sure it is fresh not old for such a high price
health	this is garbage food  not even the feral cats will eat it  besides  i cannot in good conscience give it to any cat since gluten and other grains are so bad for cats  wheat gluten is a cheap filler  not food  it blocks absorption of good proteins and damages kidneys and pancreas  i like newman s own organics turkey   veg  i wish i could have read the ingredients before i bought it  always read the labels first  i wanted something a little cheaper for the rescue work i do with feral cats  oh well  i do not want to make the feral cats sick  they have tough enough as it is  lesson learned 
product	product arrived on time however top of 4 cans crushed  making it very difficult to open with waste of some of the product as can can not be open from bottom 
health	i am using the once a month flea control capsules as well as these when needed  these pills seem like a waste of money if you are using both and your house is not completely infested   just buy the other ones  you would be better off using them and just vacuuming and changing your sheets often 
product	my dogs love this  but i was a little mislead by the picture  i had 2 of these for my 2 medium size dogs and they loved it  but one of their large friends got a hold of them and kind of did some damage which made it too easy for them to get them treat out  so i needed new ones  well  all i knew was that they were red and the picture looked like the ones we had before  wrong  it came to me yellow and much bigger  i just wished amazon would attach an accurate picture with the product  otherwise  these can occupy my dogs for a relaxing evening 
product	my cats really like this flavor but it is packaged in plastic wrap by the factory then shipped without any protective padding  every time i have received a shipment  there is at least one damaged can leaking out into the rest of the contents of the box  it is disgusting  i had it on subscription but decided to cancel it after this last order  so gross 
quality	i have used this food for 10 years for my champoin persions  i have ordered it from amazon on subscribe and save but i am done with that  the last bag caused my cats to be ill  having stomach problems and litter box problems  i know at the same time purina had a recall of another flavor for salmonilla but thought we were safe  if i continue to use this product  i will not trust ordering it from amazon  it is too hard to tell where it really comes from  after contacting purina several times and speaking to the vet where my poor kitties ran up a bill ovet  1000  i know this bag of food was tampered with at the amazon end      beware      do not buy this product from animals    my cats were poisoned by amazon     
product	i ordered these after it became hard to find them in the grocery store  we have 3 small breed dogs  and they have been a fan of these treats for a long time  i do not know if the issue is with freshness  with the bulk order  but i am done giving these to my dogs because they now throw them back up undigested  several hours after being given one  not every time  but enough to frustrate me into writing a review  which i never do     maybe we will try buying one bag at a time again  to see if fresher ones digest better  but i am not ordering 5 bags at once again  i hate cleaning carpets    
health	i had a flea infestation in may on both of my cats  and i used this bayer advantage ii to kill the existing fleas on both of them  in tandem while treating the rest of the house and the yard  <br  ><br  >this stuff works pretty well for the first few days    the cats pretty much stopped itching the very first day and were finally able to get restful sleep afterwards  for about 10 days afterwards  they were able to go outside for their walks  and we would not have to worry about them bringing in any fleas  or at least  any live ones that bothered them   after around the 10th day  it just stopped working altogether for both of them and they were both back to itching like crazy  since this is supposed to be a monthly application  i was bummed  the box also said multiple applications in a month are possible  as long as they are spaced out enough  so i was ended up applying this on both of my kitties about ~ every 2 weeks    while 4 5 of those days in a 2 week period they would start itching again  i would just have to wait until day 14 to reapply  by the 2nd month  3rd application  of this stuff  they both started getting bald spots on their fur in the area i applied the bayer drops on  and they started getting really lethargic  so i stopped application all together <br  ><br  >i did find a better solution    capstar and program  i have found generic versions of both of those meds on amazon for an amazing price  and have been flea free for the past 3 months  and have only spent a total of  35 for flea control for both kitties for 3 months    compared to spending  60 for 1 5 months of not so effective control from this bayer product   the oral meds also have not had any side effects on either of my kitties  so i am relieved to finally have found an affordable  less toxic  and effective flea treatment for my kitties  sadly  bayer was not it 
quality	i am not sure why   they are not usually finicky  but they just do not like this food  i have been feeding them friskies canned food for years and they like all the other flavors we have tried  even the   34 non specific  34  ones with names like   34 captain s choice  34   but there is something about this one they just turn up their noses 
health	we use greenies canine pill pockets all the time because our dog takes 9 different medications twice daily  we ordered online because the price was so good but when it arrived it was obviously spoiled   the stench was horrible  it is not the product   it is where you buy it  i got it once from our vet and the same problem   the smell almost made me vomit and i am not exaggerating  only buy these locally at a retail seller that will guarantee their products  if it smells rotten   take it back 
product	i could not use it properly as it requires a non clumping litter with no additives    not sure which one that should be  i even bought a new litter box but my cat refused to go in there   <br  >it s expensive for what it does not do  i rated it three stars as some might find it usable  this was my experience but the product might be good 
product	the founder of whole life  john  states \\ if you care about the health and happiness of your dog or cat  i encourage you to put your trust in whole life pet products  the healthiest  tastiest pet treats on earth \\ <br  >well john  we did just that  and today  after much researching for a healthy organic cat treat  we received our order of both the organic chicken and the freeze dried fresh pure code cat treats  our desire was to give our cat a treat that was healthy and fresh   even at the exorbitant combined cost of nearly  30 for just one ounce of each treat  total 2 bags  1 ounce each  <br  >you state on your packaging \\    there are hundreds of so called healthy products that talk the talk  but do not walk the walk \\   whole life  you most certainly did not \\ walk the walk\\  <br  >you state that at whole life \\ we produce all our treats in small fresh batches with a quality standard and a taste superior to anything your pet has ever tried \\  that being said  what explanation can you possibly offer to a first  and now only  time customer for items ordered in and received in september 2013 coming into a pet owners home with an expiration date that has already passed   and it is not just a few days   it is months  the chicken is clearly marked \\ exp 07 2013\\   the date on the cod is not clear as it is stamped lightly on the seal part of the package  if pressed  i would say it looks to read \\ exp 01 2013\\ unforgivable  i am beyond furious  where is the \\ quality standard\\  you boast of   what part of \\ healthiest and tastiest pet treat on earth\\  includes an expired product    we put our trust in you to provide the product you described  and we got nothing but useless crap that we now have to spend time returning to ensure a refund  time   a reason as to why we use amazon   to save time  i am just glad we saw the expiration date before actually feeding it to our cat  she was excited and seemed eager to try this product after we let her smell the open bag of cod  luckily  we were still looking over both bags and reading the packaging before giving it to her to consume  now  instead of a happy moment giving our pet a delicious healthy treat  she is looking at us like \\ hello  i smell it    give me \\  and we cannot cause whole life sent us expired treats  shame on you  and belle  says \\ hhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssss        \\ 
quality	i have given my dogs these treats for a year now    and here is what i have experienced  initially the first several orders were fine other than the fact that they would often come 2 3rds crumbled up    which is not nice feeding my dogs crumbs  but my dogs seemed to be in love with whatever they have put in these    so i continued to purchase     then i started getting frequent bad batches    as some of the other reviewers have mentioned  just a little put off that the bag is only half full <br  ><br  >you can tell they are bad because they are much darker in color than the good ones and they are dried out  dogs would not eat them    bad batches started coming more often along with more crushed smashed crumbled batches    mmmmmm quality control gone to heck here  making too much money now so they do not care any more <br  ><br  >additionally  the other treats that my dogs used to love that were more reasonably priced they will not even look at anymore    mmmmmm   i am going to have to research exactly what is in this product that is actually  addictive  to dogs    as they are to mine    addiction of any kind is not good  and in fact has me very concerned about this product     i will be re reviewing the ingredients    before i repurchase 
product	my dogs do enjoy the treats  however they are very expensive for the small amount that you receive when ordering this bag  when using them in the kong they do not serve much purpose at all  as the dog will take one second flat to simply retrieve the treat out of the toy  no entertainment value there  better off using any other  more reasonable priced treat in combination with the toy  i also recommend using peanut butter to fill the toy and then freeze it to make it last longer  i will not buy these treats again  overpriced  useless with the toy and just overall a very poor value 
quality	this stuff is really really bad    the smell is pungent and smells like putrified fish <br  ><br  >my dogs eat fish when i cook it they love it    and of course the fish oil is good for them like it is for us  well the smell is so bad on this when i opened the bag i thought i was going to regurgitate  now that is not an exaggeration it is the truth <br  ><br  >i am amazed    that there are as many good reviews on this product as there are but i have also learned that there are many 5 star shills on the amazon reviews <br  ><br  >my dogs would not eat and it went back 
quality	bought this product based on the reviews but  my betta fish  do not even look at it  it floats for days and  i finally just remove it  will not buy this ever again 
quality	tiki is a great high quality cat food maker and this one is no exception  it contained real sardines in a solid consomme  my cats  however  must not like sardines as they refused to eat it  so if your cats like sardines this is the product for them 
product	my dog loves this toy  so much so that i bought him 6 because he keeps burying them  today i noticed that the refills say \\ made in taiwan \\  treats from china have been shown to kill dogs  i will not buy them anymore  i will start to make my own  as i already do for chicken and liver treats  i contacted petsafe to ask about the possibility that they will carry us made refills  if enough of us complain  and boycott the refills  hopefully they will <br  ><br  >update  i called other rawhide companies and you really have to call each one to find out where they get their materials  sadly  some of their products are made from materials coming from china  too  they  also  swear it is safe  we know it is not <br  ><br  >solution found   <br  >i dehydrate liver and chicken to make healthy treats for my dog  family dogs and friends  dogs all the time  i decided to cut the liver to fit the bristle bone  then dehydrate it  but cutting it to shape was a pain  i also tried putting doggie toothpaste on it  but that did not work at all <br  ><br  >then it hit me  i just cut the beef liver into thin strips and turn them to form a circle  letting the ends overlap  i then put them in my dehydrator with my other treats  success  they fit the toy beautifully and my dog liked it even better than before  if you follow my lead  do not overdo with the liver  it is good for the dog as long as you do not give him or her too much <br  ><br  >i m going to try another remedy  i bought a pet treat maker and found that you can use hamburger  or any ground meat  to make jerky for dogs  i am now looking for a mini donut or bunt pan  if we can find one that is 2\\  in diameter  it might just be perfect for our needs  if i find one  i will try to repost <br  ><br  >update 2  i got my kitchen aide mixer out and ground up chicken  i mixed in some corn flour as a binding agent  then i put it into the jerky press  nesco bjx 5 american harvest jumbo  i angled the press to make the meat coming out turn a bit  a method used for making icing flowers in cake decorating  i did it on a non stick silicone sheet  then transferred them to parchment paper for the dehydrator  i had to adjust them by hand to get the circle right  but it works  i also did it with hamburger  but the dog did not like them  the chicken is healthier than giving him lots of liver  though he gets a toy with liver each day  too  they are not perfect  but it works  and the dogs like it  just an fyi  if you are interested in making your own refills  to get the meat to come out in a circle  hold the \\ gun\\  at a 45 degree angle and twist your wrist in a clockwise direction while dispensing the meat  3 4 clicks should make a nice circle  adjust it with your fingers  works great  and the dog loves it <br  ><br  >hope this was helpful  here s to keeping our dogs happy and healthy g out turn a bit  a method used for making icing flowers in cake decorating  i did it on a non stick silicone sheet  then transferred them to parchment paper for the dehydrator  i had to adjust them by hand to get the circle right  but it works  i also did it with hamburger  but the dog did not like them  the chicken is healthier than giving him lots of liver  though he gets a toy with liver each day  too  they are not perfect  but it works  and the dogs like it  just an fyi  if you are interested in making your own refills  to get the meat to come out in a circle  hold the \\ gun\\  at a 45 degree angle and twist your wrist in a clockwise direction while dispensing the meat  3 4 clicks should make a nice circle  adjust it with your fingers  works great  and the dog loves it <br  ><br  >hope this was helpful  here s to keeping our dogs happy and healthy 
product	these are my dogs favorite treat  i was excited to see american kennel club and no where in amazon s description does it say made in china  when the product got here sure enough on the back manufactured in china  we are all very disappointed 
product	the product is acceptable for it is intent  i expected to receive the 7 9 oz size  i did not realize the tablet was the smaller size and that is the only indication in the picture  if the picture were enlarged to an adequate size to read the description  it would help also  other vendors make a point to include the size in the description  i will purchase from other vendors for a better price in the future 
quality	because i was not able to find large or extra large nutri dent for my german shepherd i decided to try finding some on line and was able to find the large ones  i noted they did not smell right but thought it might be because they were not bacon flavored like i am used to buying but to my dismay found the coupon inside expired 6 12 so the reason it smelled different and was crumbly is because it was out dated  i do not feed myself outdated food and i do not feed my dogs anything outdated either  i just threw away  27 so i will not be getting anymore  i will buy local and give her more than one  at least if i buy local  i can take it back and get a refund 
quality	cat has to scratch too hard to make the food come out and have to use limited food shape<br  >i would not recommend it
health	i gave this thing to my cat  and she threw up  i have now learnt that this has happened to many other cats  i did a tasting session with a different variety  the free range chicken  and she seemed fine  threw up only once when she finished the package  with this  she threw up right after the first snacking <br  >please beware of this food  and if you see vomit  make the connection 
product	i only give these 1 star because amazon did take them back and refund my money and they make me  otherwise i would give them negative stars  i took them out of the box and it was obvious they were really cheap garbage  i expected that based on the price  but i did not expect them to be that pathetic  seriously  these are not worth two cents unless you can get a few cents from recycling them  i filled up the waterer and put the lid on  it immediately started leaking from all around the lid  i did not even bother with the feeder  i put them straight back in the box and returned them  do not waste your time 
product	far too expensive but the dogs like it   not much in the bag   cannot get by subscribe   save so definitely will not buy it again
product	the package i received is suspect  the chicken wrap is black and the liver bite is very hard  my dog still loves them but i am uneasy about giving her anymore of these 
quality	this is more like the cheapest imitation of beggin  strips  they smell to high heaven  and my dog will not go near them  when something is described as   34 jerky  34  it indicates that it is a meat product that is dehydrated  this is processed  chemicals added  and smells very highly of chemicals that have been added  yes  they are made in the us  too bad because it is an inferior and disgusting product  and a waste of good american lambs 
quality	i must admit my dog loves these  i tossed them in the trash they smelled so incredibly bad  beware the stink is unbelievable 
product	my cats used to love this treat and i ordered a pack of 10 only to find out the recipe was changed  now they have molasses  our cats have never had sugar or a sugar product and they never will  it is toxic for cats  and  this is a non refundable item so i am out over  20  i went to the vitakitty website and they never say there is molasses in the product or that they changed the product  it is irreponsible of them not to include this in the ingredients on the website or the amazon listing  i tried to call the company and was on hold for over 30 minutes  finally left a message  if they call me back and refund my money then i will edit this comment with something positive  sheesh  i would have given this item no stars but that is not an option  update  amazon is giving me a full refund for the product and i am tossing the 10 bags in the trash 
product	seems like a fine product for some dogs  however  my dog does not have the patience for things like this  and she completely destroyed the entire thing in an effort to get the treat  not worth the money  but if your dog is not destructive  it will probably be fine 
quality	my guinea pig will not touch this food  and loves kaytee s other brand of food  fiesta  i will never buy this again   27 down the drain 
product	i was disappointed with this purchase i have 3 dogs that vary in size  all three were interested in eating them but every one of them had difficulty breaking them apart with there teeth  might work for really large dogs   but definitely difficult eating for small and medium size dogs 
quality	three out of three dogs did not like it  and they are not picky eaters  too expensive to throw away  i will take it to the local shelter  hopefully some of the dogs there will eat it 
product	this product did not work at all  do not buy         used all dog still has fleas just made him itch more 
product	i was disappointed in this product  it came highly recommend by my vet  but it is not better than a number of cheaper products on the market   including more environmentally friendly items  the residual is highly overstated by the manufacture 
product	the little yorkie was not really excited with these  the bag is a small bag and does not have much of the product  probably will not order these again 
health	rude customer service  i bought the little city dog month control and adult flea killer  both to use at same time   i gave the monthly control  then the daily pill for adult fleas for 10 days  i took my dog to the vet for other issues not related to flea control  my vet said  \\ your dog has fleas \\  both meds were useless  i gave my dog more of the daily pills  i was looking for the program and this popped up  i needed something that was not poisonous to my dog  i thought this was a good choice <br  ><br  >i was wrong  my dog never gets infested by fleas and my house does not have them  but she gets grass fleas on occasion  i have read online from holistic blogs that your dogs diet has a lot to do with fleas infesting your pets  or having just a small problem  my dog is on a holistic diet <br  ><br  >i contacted little city dog asking what else i can do to get their product to work  at first they sent me a generic email response  i emailed them back saying you did not answer the question  they replied with this very unprofessional  rude comment  \\ what you are saying about diet has nothing at all to do with fleas  you have a flea infestation we did not cause it \\ <br  ><br  >diet does have something to do with it  so clearly they have hired a person who would rather respond rudely than work with you  do you want to buy a product from a company that treats their customers this way <br  ><br  >needless to say  i do not recommend this product and have put in for a refund 
quality	but they got over it  well  one did and the other didn t  would turn his nose up and walk away  i did not care for the smell of the strips when i would open the container  it is not a bad smell  or anything like that  just a   34 hmm i don t like it  34  smell  dogs showed no ill effects from eating them  and the container is a very handy size for treats 
health	this food does help with our dog s skin allergies irritation  i would give it a higher rating  but they are being a little greedy with pricing compared to other science diet formulas  i am sure this is being driven by the manufacturer and the retailers combined   they are taking advantage of   34 captive  34  customers  i have searched several online sites and in stores ~ 46 is about the best i have found 
product	the packaging was so bad that a can broke open in transit  half of the other cans are so dented i dare not give this to my cat  i am sending back for a refund  i have never had an issue getting the original line of merrick before grain at all  it is unfortunate that they change their line of food and this happens  i am going to stop using amazon for the wet food and pay more to get it locally 
product	i suspect it is that these medleys have smaller chunks than most other fancy feast varieties  grilled  sliced  etc    but for some reason  my cat always eats these way too fast  and then barfs them up right next to his bowl  sometimes the same thing happened with the gravy lovers flavors of fancy feast  too  so maybe it is the higher ratio of sauce to meat  or   34 meat  34    and since these cost significantly more than regular fancy feasts  except that one time amazon accidentally sent me a two pack instead of just one box   i do not see any reason to buy my cat something he is just going to barf  he does love them  and always demands a replacement can  which he tries very hard to eat more slowly  but we are sticking to the chunkier varieties from here on out  these are not worth the premium 
product	i purchased this product thinking it will be great for my dogs but i was so wrong  i have tried giving them each two  2  pieces n they got the runs by the next morning  so i tried just one  1  piece each n still the same results  i was extremely disappointed as i read the contents n reviews n thought it would be a great product <br  >either my dogs are allergic to whatever pure products are in contents or just sensitive dogs  in either case i was very disappointed that they had such a reaction n will give away   
product	this was absolutely a waste of money  i followed the directions to the letter and this product was completely ineffective 
product	stick with the pricier brands  this did not seem to work at all  our cats were very disappointed and still have fleas 
product	it did not work as good as the one i have been using  i will not buy it again  went back to old product
quality	i did not eat it smile   but none of my 3 cats liked it   i gave it to my friend and her cat would not eat it 
health	i used this ear cleaner on a 17 year old dachshund with chronic renal failure and cataracts  she was maintaining well despite her problems but a few days after using this solution she started having tarry black stool and her cataracts severely worsened  i did an internet search and found that hydrocortisone can cause both of those problems  i immediately stopped usage and her stool is almost back to normal but now her eyes are in very poor shape  and when added to her other problems  deafness   will likely require us to put her down <br  ><br  >in general  topically applied hydrocortisone is supposed to be safe  but the inside of a dog s ear has very thin skin  some pain medications are applied to the ear because of this  such as when we had her remaining teeth extracted   i am sure her kidneys took longer to flush any of the hydrocortisone that got into her bloodstream too <br  ><br  >this medication probably works well in most cases but i wanted to post this review as a warning to those seeking a cure for an elderly dog or a dog with other health complications  try out a milder ear cleaner first  preferably one without the use of a corticosteroid 
health	it is taken me awhile to come to the conclusion that all commercial pet foods are making our pets sick  some brands are better than others but none are what our pets really need  i give the limited ingredient diet turkey three stars because one  my cat will eat it and two so far he does not seem to be allergic to it  i will not rate it any higher because it has vegetables in it  cats cannot derive any nutrients from vegetables but they can upset the digestive system  their bodies are not designed for digesting vegetables  the other reason i will not rate it any higher is because it is my understanding that this particular brand and flavor has a very high percentage of fat  my cat  who is already overweight while eating very little  gains weight on this cat food  we are trying very hard to transitioning him over to raw food but he has so many food allergies and digestive problems that it is a very slow process  we take a few steps forward and a few steps back and i am not sure who is winning  all these food allergies and digestive problems are probably from feeding commercial cat food in the first place  the other cause is probably too many vaccines  do yourself a favor and try transitioning your cat over to raw food  it can be cheaper in the long run  make sure you do it correctly  though  dr  karen becker  dvm claims the best food you can give your cat is a balanced raw diet  the worst food you can give your cat is an unbalanced raw diet  you can see all of dr  becker s videos on youtube  i will probably continue to buy this canned cat food until our cat is transitioned over to raw food permanently because he likes it and will eat it  my goal is to kiss all commercial pet food good bye 
quality	i bought this for my 15 year old cat with renal insufficiency  but she will not eat  it  must need flavor  or a cat appealing smell
product	small and easy to administor but did not really work  fleas crawled off dog skin onto fur for a while but that is is it  they were still on him  i am not buying again 
product	my small dog can demolish one of these bones in less than 10 minutes  do not buy these to keep your dog occupied for very long  but perhaps as a small treat 
quality	our dog would not eat them no matter how hard we tried  not sure it is the products fault as the chicken or salmon ones are no problem 
product	i keep ordering this stuff via subscribe and save and like clockwork the price is raised on subsequent orders  disappointing 
health	the strips were as thin as paper and my dog could not even chew them  i would not recommend this to anyone  my dog threw up constantly the few days while eating trying to eat them  which she could not do until i tore them up and folded them lol
health	we tried the sensitive stomach formula and now the hairball and neither is that impressive  our cat still barfs from time to time 
health	my dog started vomiting and having diarrhea for about 6 hours following eating several of these treats  he has never had blueberries  so perhaps they did not agree with him 
quality	used to be my cat s favorite  but now it stinks so badly that i am not really sure what happened to it 
health	these smell terrible and they shred like blades of grass which i find worrisome afraid she will choke  you get what you pay for    
health	one of my dogs has allergies  switching to this brand affected him negatively  his coat was duller  his skin flaky and his ear<br  >inflammation flared up <br  >going back to natures recipe   the best i have found   for all 3 of my dogs
quality	my kitty really seemed to like them at first  now she will not eat them  but my baby is pretty finicky 
product	my dogs  2 of whom will eat anything  were not particularly fond of these  got to where they would turn up their noses at the treats  a little pricey  too 
product	dog gets frustrated  he can see treats  the one we had  but got lost  he could not see the treats and would nose it around forever 
health	did not work at all  made my cats sick foaming at the mouth and throwing up  i do not recommend this product 
quality	i was all excited about buyiong a big bulk pack of greenies for my new dog since i have read the dental benefits they bring  then i found out that after eating one once  he refused to eat them again  and talking to people i have found that it is very common for dogs not to like the taste of greenies <br  ><br  >now i have a box with 95 greenies that i have to get rid off and it was a waste of money 
quality	i bought this for my dog who has renal failure and was so skinny  she would not touch the stuff  i was curious if it was her or if it really is bad tasting or smelling  i tried 3 other dogs and none of them would even lick it 
health	the spray does not work it smells like rubbing alcohol i spray it on my dogs it does not work now i have infestation with fleas i have dachshunds that loves to play outside  not a good product
product	i have 900 gallon pond with suddenly dark water  applied treatment twice  no visible improvement  pond is constantly aerated  will not buy this product again 
product	the puppy sized small kong toy was much smaller then the picture on the website led you to believe  we were disappointed in its size 
product	i purchased this item without realising it was different from the one i usually order  the med i usually get does not have the  8 weeks   older  on the label  thinking it was just new packaging  i used it on my cat  he is now full of fleas  do not know if it was a weaker formula or what  but  frontline plus usaully works for us  disappointed 
health	very disappointed  my dog has food allergies so she cannot have beef or chicken  she loves fresh venison  to bad this was old  stale and did not smell like venison  poor daisy  disappointed hotdog 
product	i just received my second case of this dog food  as mentioned by another seller  at least half the cans are dented  when i received my first case i thought it was strange  but decided to order another case  these were dented too  customer service told me to call the manufacturer   nice service 
product	too small would be better if a lot bigger pretty expensive too  i would not order again but chickens liked them
quality	i like the ingredients in this product  but my dog refused to eat it  after many tries  i finally gave up and gave the whole bag away to my dog sitter in case the other dogs might eat it  my dog is not that picky  but she was not having any of this  oh well 
health	i have a 4 year old malti poo who has severe allergy to chicken  at least  do not know for sure what else  he was put on a prescription venison based dog food ordered by a vet  so he uses the dry and the canned version of that  since he was able to eat venison based dog food  i thought the wellness pure rewards venison would be ok   but i gave him a few bites of these last night and he cannot comfortably lay down today because his stomach seems to be hurting so bad  took him out and all he did was eat grass each time  i can hear his stomach making weird noises  and he has not eaten a bite since the venison treats at bedtime last night  so it has to be these treats that made him sick  i know he can eat venison  so one of the other ingredients has to have made him sick  i wish he could eat these  because he never ever gets a treat of any kind now     i will not buy them again <br  >oh  and i will say that the prescription food my dog gets from the vet is processed in a plant where no chicken is processed  don t know if that matters  but it might be that this is processed where they make the chicken   turkey treats  i just know my baby cannot eat them 
quality	states \\ tested safe in usa\\   package says \\ made in china\\   no thanks  after the happy hips safety recall  china  that were recalled due to unsafe ingredients  no more china  my dog loves these  unfortunately for him  i love him more 
product	i got this info when i purchased a set of bowls for my dog  dog likes it but it is not worth any where what they are selling for
product	my cats like it  but it really does not help with hair balls  the prevention or elimination of them  will not buy such a big bag again 
quality	when i opened the pouch  sure enough they were pieces of dried turkey that felt just like styrofoam  they had no smell to them  my cat would not touch these and neither would the dogs  i do not know why they would be appealing to any animal  i know there are 5 stars out there  i just do not agree 
product	way to expensive  my dog was able to get this treat out in 30 seconds  no joke  5 seconds later the treat was devoured by my 35lb beagle mix  look elsewere for treats
health	we have bought these strips many times in the past and our dog loved them  however this bag seemed a little discolored and the aroma was different  we gave our dog 2 of them and he promptly got sick  bag was thrown away 
health	i have tried this product in another flavor once before and it was o k  our dog likes them but aside from the fact it takes him less than 15 min to get out  this second package we have opened has made him extremely sick  last time different package he had loose stools which is not highly unusual for a product of this quality  but he never got sick  all day  our dog has been throwing up and after the 6th time  we finally had to call the vet and are headed to take him in now  i came online curious if others are reporting the same and it appears other dogs have been sick from this product as well <br  ><br  >would not recommend  not worth it to the health of your dog or your emergency vet bill costs if you wind up in this category 
product	i received the product in a timely manner and my cat likes this food so that was not the problem  the problem was that over half of the cans were received dented and some were so mangled i could not open them and had to just throw them away 
quality	she is kind of fussy  but she does not like these  they are crispy treats   not soft ones  just a taste difference 
health	i order this product along with other items and they arrived today  i was so happy until i open salmon treat  on the package it said \\ 100  whole meat treats freeze dried wild salmon for dogs and cats\\   it looks quite oily  dried and brittle  however  the texture is not anywhere near other freeze dried products  fruits or meats  i ever have which is spongy  i am not sure if it simply because this product has not been dried from fresh salmon  contain lots of water  then freeze and dried  in that case  ice crystal will be taken out leaving a spongy texture behind <br  ><br  >it appears that  if it ever freeze dried  this product has gone to other processings before  perhaps  from dried or smoke dried  there is a sticker cover the entire back packaging label  so i cannot tell if other ingredient s  being added  as suspecious as i am  i test a little bit of it <br  ><br  >pet owner beware  this product is very salty  i order this item for my cats and do not think it is a good idea to give them salty snack  what kind of mindset of manufacture to add so much salt to pet snack  my cats need to have as much water as they can  not to eat this kind of unhealthy salty snack <br  ><br  >oh  i just see best by at the bottom of a container  it is 25 sep 2013  ha  you give me only 1 month to use the product  seriously 
product	way overpriced  how can a thimble full of this stuff cost so much <br  >i recommend buying the generic stuff  it works just as good 
product	i love this product   i gave this one star because the i very much dislike the seller   i ordered this online so that i did not have to go to the store to purchase  i work for a living and that is more convenient to order most items online  i came home from work today to find a note from the post office that this package was undeliverable due to no one home to sign for it  i could come to the post office to pick it up  now does not that defeat the purpose of ordering something online  i still have to waste my time and gas to go pick up what i could have just bought from the store  do not order from these folks unless you are home all the time to sign for the package  i hope i have arranged with the post office to get this redelivered  if not  it will go back and i will either order elsewhere or go to the store  rest assure i will never use this seller again     
product	this is the 2nd out 3 recent shipments of this product that appears to have been retrieved from the   34 bottom of the barrel  34   that is  about 1 4 of the bag s content looks like ground up peanuts shells  normally  there is only small amount of this material which could possibly be a result of handling and shipping  but  it’s very frustrating when i have to discard this inedible filling  which i’m sure  is included in the weight of the package resulting in a reduction of edible feed and a higher per volume feed cost  i have had to separate the edible material from the inedible using a colander  i had to do this in order to ensure that the bird was getting a proper allotment of feed  i’ve purchased this product 10 times over the last 15 months and up to recent have been very pleased  but  if the next shipment has the same problem  i will have to look elsewhere 
quality	like the other reviewer  i appreciate these healthy   natural snack options for dogs  unfortunately  my two chihuahua dogs do not enjoy them  the snacks are also too big for them  so i have to break them into smaller pieces for my chihuahuas  i have not noticed any difference in their skin or fur  but i will not fault the product because the dogs have not eaten enough of the treats for me to judge 
health	the picture was a bit deceiving  i would not purchase again  they are so skinny  tiny  i would be afraid of choking
health	i purchased the pro plan kitten select for my six month old bengal  i gave it to her three times  and each time  she vomited after eating it <br  >however  not wanting to miss anything  my three year old tabby ate it  when i fed my kitten  she loves it  and has had no vomiting or any other problems  so now she eats it along with her regular adult cat food <br  >at least  it will not go to waste <br  ><br  >thanx <br  ><br  >d  m  shae
product	misleading info  paid  7 for 1 pkg while the catnip flavor came in a package of 6 for approx same price 
product	the product was an improvement over the flea control medication that i used with my cats last year  however  while my husband was trying to help me apply the solution  it squirted in his eye  it takes two hands to open the tube cap which you then have to insert in to the top of the tube  this can be a challenge when trying to apply it to some cats who are not willing to sit still and wait for the process  they need to re design the package 
quality	i would not buy these again  i do not like the way they splinter and can only imagine what they do going through my dog s intestines  i will choose wiser next time 
health	the kibble are too big and too hard for most of my cats  but they like the taste so they do try to eat it and sometimes would end up swallowing the kibble whole only to have it upset their stomach and they would vomit it back up  the ones who could crunch it did not show any improvement in their dental health  but i was only able to feed it as supplemental treat type food because of the ones who were unable to crunch it 
quality	my little dog would not eat this  i had to give it away to a less picky dog  who liked it just fine 
quality	my dogs cannot get the treat out  the cups are too hard to flip out  the give up and loose interesr
product	the product is good but is mispriced all you get is one tiny little pouch that can be bought for less than 2 00 at any store  many others have complained about this here too you do not get a large sack or multiple sacks  it cannot be returned  requesting a refund 
product	had to order these as the dogs favorite chicken and duck strips have disappeared  since made by dogs well  thought they would be as good  was knocked down by the fish smell when opened package  even my chis were surprised by the smell and they had to think twice about eating them  definitely not going to be put in night stand by my bed for good night treats  
health	i used to like them for my dog but was a little scared of them coming from china and then when i got the email letting me know that something was found in them that was not supposed to be there i have stopped getting them  they said it would not hurt my dog what was found in them but if that can happen no telling what else could slip through and harm my dog 
product	my friend who has a 5 year old germanshepard recommended this product for my 1 1 2 year old husky  within 30 min<br  >he had begun to rip off chunks of the blue plastic ball that surrounds the treat puck  we had to take it away and throw it in the trash to keeps him safe  i guess the hunt continues for a powerful toy that can handle those powerful teeth 
quality	not that i do not like it    my cats will not eat it  sorry  they used to i do not know what else to tell you 
product	the hard plastic ball makes a lot of noise as the dog pushes it around the hard wood floors  it also has dented the floors when she got a little too excited to get the treats out  she can pick it up by the opening but then drops it  causing the damage to the floors  i do like that you can adjust the size of the treat hole to fit different types of treats 
product	i bought these thinking they would be chewy like the pig ears  but these are more like really big crunchy treats  the dogs like them  but they do not last long  since i expected something chewy enough to keep them occupied for a while  this was a little disappointing  but for what they are  they are fine  the lab finishes one in about a minute and i have to break off a piece for the poodle since it is too big for him  but he also finishes in about a minute  does not seem to smell like other natural animal treats 
product	the package was so small  but the dogs loved it  i just wish i could afford to buy more for them 
health	my cat loved these at first  but he got sick of gnawing on them so he now will not even eat them  if they were an actual soft chew they would be great 
product	i purchased it a about a month ago and i paid  8 12  now it sells for  12 00 a package and it weighs the same  i weighed the package because it does not mention weight and it weighs 4 5 oz  i do not understand why it has gone up by  4 00 in a month  my dog likes it  however  there are very good treats out there for a much cheaper price  i wish amazon will be competitive with other websites  for  12 00 i can buy it anywhere  i purchased in bj s 3 lbs of freeze dried chicken fillets for  16 00 and my dog likes them much more than the chubby chews  i gave it 3 stars because of the bad value even at  8 12 
quality	my dogs will not eat the bones so far  i have only tried the sweet potato but my yorkie loves sweet potatoes 
quality	the cats love the food  though i am trying to switch them to better brands with less fillers  but the case arrived stinking and slimy as several cans were broken in transit  i only kept half  fearful the seal might be compromised on others  i did write amazon  but received no response to my complaint  not their best work to date 
product	the chicken flavor part of this product is useless as our dog will not take eat these pills without them being hidden in some real food  the efficacy is not there either   while a previous review i wrote about this was taken down  i am guessing because this company is using the standard medication that any vet would normally use  i am not seeing it work as they claim it will  i followed their instructions closely and repeated the dose as instructed but ended up having to take our dog to the vet anyway  sometimes going cheap just comes out more expensive    this is one of those times  i cannot recommend this product  and i really think amazon should not be taking down these reviews because they are negative   if we have a negative experience with a product then we have a right to say that 
health	would have been nice to know that these are \\ inserts\\  for an exiting toy  but it may be my fault for not reading all the fine print  dogs like them but it does not agree with their tummy  had to throw them out cause 3 dogs all got the runs from eating them <br  ><br  >maybe its my dogs but 3 dogs all getting sick does not sound logical 
product	this stuff is really sharp and difficult to get out of the package  i prefer the store brand we purchased before 
quality	my dogs do not care for this item  i have 3 dogs that are chewers and non of them will touch it 
quality	both of my picky eaters will not touch this  frustrating  as i want to do the best for them  but neither one will eat it  they will actually pass it by and not eat at all the whole day instead of eating it  ugh 
quality	first of all  this 25 pound bag does not have any information on it    no label  no picture  no nutritional information  a little ominous  if you ask me  it is just a huge white bag  but more importantly  my piggies will not eat this stuff  i have given them a few different brands of food over the years with no complaints  but they actually spit these pellets out  now i have 25 pounds of guinea pig food that is going to go to waste  i am going to try mixing it with oxbow  which they love  i bought this brand to save some money  but it looks like i will end up spending even more 
product	left foster and smith to find slightly cheaper smoked pig ears for my huge dogs    6 great pyrenees and 1 great dane       at 121 dollars i thought for 100 that is good        i was wrong        what arrived were 4 bags of 25 each  and most are just little teeny ears like from a kitten or something that size      very few large ones and my dogs eat large       totally disappointed and will never  ever buy from them again           i should get a refund for being taken  5 inches to 7 is a joke to say the least        shame
quality	i tried this product along with the monthly treatment for fleas from same company and it did nothing  the stuff looks home made and is virtually useless  please  save your pet and yourself time and effort and avoid this product  not a hater   just do not like being taken advantage of and having my pet suffer needlessly because some product does not do anything it said it did 
health	my munchkin was 7 weeks old when i adopted him  he was malnourished   sleepy and lethargic  on blue wilderness  no soy or grain  and missing link  he quickly bounced back and exploded  my now 14lb not even a year old little meow has been a food monster  he almost immediately struggled with food agression       once we worked past that he would eat until he threw up   after we broke that habit  he would snack a lot  he is never been overweight  but i am very careful to make sure he gets enough exercise and have worked really hard to minimize his food obsession    <br  >now to the reason for this purchase   <br  >he gets about 1 2 of dry food left out at a time to supplement his wet food  this food sometimes gets wolfed in a day  others lasts 2 3 days depending on his activity    unfortunately  he shoves his face in the bowl and food gets all over the floor   then i put the bowl away so he can eat up the mess  after i got tired of repeatedly cleaning it up     it was exhausting    <br  >so i got the kong    to nix the mess and break the food fixation at meal time <br  >almost immediately i was surprised at how big it was  it was very well weighted though   as far as the toy tail goes  he had that thing in his mouth and was dragging and trying to flail it across the house  leaving a trail of food in his wake  my eyes almost exploded out of my head  panicking  thinking \\ what am i gonna do   this is worse than before  \\  <br  >first i took the toy tail off the top  it snaps right off and can be reattached later  with that problem solved  i noticed the hole for dispensing food was very large  it often dispensed more food than he could eat by the time he was filling up so i would still find kibbles on the floor  i grabbed some tape and covered half of the hole  that has done the trick  it now works exactly the way i wanted it to and my little guy gets plenty of food and stimulation  he does not park at the food bowl or leave a mess everywhere  with half of the hole taped  only three or four pieces of food come out at a time    the perfect amount  it also holds twice as much food as the light blue treat ball that my parents have for their cat <br  >now to why i gave it three stars    <br  >i am a groomer   i have done or seen most of it all and am much better at reading and handling felines than their counterparts  i have often recommended and had sucess with the smaller blue treat ball  for me and my cats caloric requirements  it simply did not hold enough food    so i jumped at the chance to try the kong <br  >firstly  the toy is unnecessary   yes this is supposed to be a \\ treat\\  toy   but it holds over a cup of food when filled to capacity    even at half that  what cat needs that many treats out and about   its huge  it also dispenses amounts more suited to meals than treats   either make a smaller version for treats or have this one as a designated feeder <br  >second  the dispensing hole needs to be adjustable  the size and weight of this item are perfect for food  but since it only has one hole  it would have been smart to make it adjustable <br  >other than that its great  i gave it three stars because it required a bit of modification to not leave a food everywhere  but i would buy it again and recommend the modified version to those in a similar situation as me  kong products are usually well thought out and virtually kink free    so i was surprised at this design  but its the only feeder treat dispenser of its size and weight   so it is ideally suited for food <br  >hope this helps

quality	we have two dogs  one can chew this treat  the other tried to chew it but found it too hard and just left it on the floor  i did cut it for her into smaller pieces and she was able to eat it that way 
quality	i only give this a 3 star based on the fact that my dogs did not care for it  however  when i gave the almost full bag to a friend  his dog went nuts over it and he more than likely would give it a 5 star    
product	there are four sticks in this package  about three inches each  two sticks arrived complete but the other two had half way crumbled  assume 
health	i used to feed my cats wysong in the past  my older kitty recently had pu surgery after repeated blockages from struvite crystals  since i am not a big fan of the more common prescription diets for cats  i was keen to see if the wysong uretic would work for him  unfortunately  though he liked the taste of the food  he started having a flareup of his ibs after eating it for a few days  not knowing if the flareup was definitely caused by the uretic or something else  i still had to stop feeding him the uretic to be on the safe side  and since he stopped eating the uretic his ibs symptoms have decreased significantly  so  based on my most recent experience with wysong uretic  i hesitate to recommend it to other people whose cats have similar health issues 
health	my dogs were not to excited about this treat  i do not think it has much taste  but on<br  >a positive note   it agrees with my dog that has stomach issues  it never threw<br  >up once 
product	this arrived on time  but the box  the product box  not the amazon box  was crushed  opened  and the contents sliding out  does not give me confidence about the legitimacy of the product 
quality	we are huge fans of cesar s from his early dog whisperer days and thought this must be a top notch product for cesar to endorse it  not so  we have gone all natural with our dog   she eats home cooked  carefully prepared foods and we are very particular about the ingredients in store bought treats  these beef liver treats were awful  they were so hard   craggy  our dog could not chew them  i hope cesar reads this and looks into modifying the way they are processed  on the plus side  cesar s healthy beef pizzle sticks were good   our dog liked them and they seemed a good quality and did not stink like some of them can  they are 4\\  and most likely intended for smaller dogs  one of her favorite treats is o paws dried turkey hearts and we highly recommend them     would have included the link  but i am not sure they are available through amazon anymore 
quality	my min pin does not like car rides  so we got this product hoping it would help  it did not and our 8 hour car ride seemed like it lasted for ever 
product	counterfeit do not buy this brand   bought it for months and now it does not work  so many people have complained  wish i had listened
product	i purchased the one recommended for small dogs up too 20lbs  my kyle is 20lbs  the unit was so small it fit less than a tablespoon of treats in it  even on the hardest setting the unit was empty in 5 minutes   yes  i time it on first use  ii immediately packed it back up  and exchanged it for the large  kyle had a great time with it  for 5 minutes  but come on  i was so annoyed with the tiny size of treats or food this thing held  i say go large and just add less treats food if need be 
product	i was disappointed in the price  an individual i worked with said that it was cheaper to buy from amazon then at the store  i found out after i bought the item that it was  2 00 cheaper per package  plus did not have to pay for shipping if i had bought it at the store  it was my fault for not checking this out before i purchased  and now i know that amazon is not the cheapest way to go 
health	my dog loved it but it was broken in small pieces within minutes  really dangerous  i was a bad experience considering usually kong products seems safe 
product	petzone shows a picture of the 25gram container  but ships  18oz vials  this makes the price very expensive  and the caps on one of the containers had come off in shipping  resulting in powder coming out of the envelope and all over the counter when the package was opened  very disappointed and will not purchase from this supplier again 
quality	i ordered 2 packages and my cats will not touch these  was disappointed as the ingredients sounded healthy and appealing   overpriced 
health	i wish i could give these treats a negative rating  when they were being made in the us  i bought nothing else for years   through the lives of two dogs  but after they started making them in china  my dog started getting ill and choking after eating them  i contacted the company on more than one occasion  and they assured me the treats were safe  now there is a recall on them because they found antibiotic residue that is not approved for use in the us <br  ><br  >do not buy these treats if you love your dog   <br  ><br  >this is no fault of amazon   they notified me immediately of the recall 
quality	i love the concept of this supplement but it depends upon your cat   some gobble them up like treats and others turn up their noses and do not eat it  i have resorted to crushing up these pellets into fine pieces and mixing them into my cat s soft food   only giving him as much as he will eat all at one time  this is do able since they are soft  maybe i will order the chicken flavored one next   to see if he will eat those by themselves  up side  they seem to actually work and i prefer these to pills 
quality	my nickey used to enjoy these when mixed in along with her regular treats to dispense medication however  this time around she is just not eating them no matter what we do and that includes putting them in with her moist food  i thought perhaps it was these particular medications that we were having to give her however she will not eat the product on it is own either so i am not sure what is going on 
quality	small size is good   good quality   dog does not like them very much   would prefer freeze dried meat   shipped timely   mseller did a good job
quality	i have three cats and i am trying to switch them to a raw food diet  upon the advice of a vet  i ordered this product as a   34 food enhancer  34  so they would be more likely to eat the raw food as this product is supposed to be very appetizing to cats  she said to sprinkle a little on their food and they will be more likely to eat it  it worked on one of my cats  but the other two continue to turn their noses to it 
product	i received a sample of these in the mail and my dogs really liked the flavor  my chihuahua has some arthritis in her shoulder so i thought i would give these vitamins a try  for what you get  i thought they were a little pricey  both of my dogs loved the flavor  no improvement in the shoulder 
quality	all three of my cats will not even touch  they take a whiff of it and walk away <br  >they usually munch on all other type of snacks 
quality	they do not have enough chicken on them will not order again also the other chucken strips i ordered first were very thin and these are not little dog does not like as well
quality	instead of gnawing in this rock hard hollow log  the gerbils played and pooped on it  it began to stink after a week or so  so i threw it out  will not be repurchasing 
product	my dogs love these biscuits and i loved the price but the biscuits were broken in little pieces twice  i requested a replacement order when the first order arrived in pieces  the second order had a few biscuits in relatively good shape  but still mostly bits of once large biscuits  am returning this one for refund  very unhappy  also not thrilled to have to repackage and go to ups twice in a row  very inconvenient and out of the way  did not see anyone else complaining of large biscuits arriving in pieces so thought it was safe to order this item  back to petco instead  it is on my way home from work 
product	i have been ordering the buddy biscuits for years in all flavors  my doxies love them and i had only raves until now  i ordered 4 boxes this go round and every single biscuit in every box was broken and worse  smashed  totally annoying when you are trying to give your pet his quota 
quality	these are relatively inexpensive  and the dogs like them  they are not high value treats  so they do not work well in training or stressful situations  and they are difficult to break into the right sized pieces   many also come broken in transit   i doubt that i will continue to purchase them 
quality	the cat developed diabetes after a series of cortisone shots for another condition  currently feeding him fresh meats  tuna  he loved his royal canin protein  but cannot have it  tried other dry  but he would not eat it   this product he loves   but i feed him this sparingly as it creates some thirst  royal canin is the best
product	this item was described as bulk with a picture of 4 or 5 bones <br  >when it arrived there was one bone in the package at a cost of  7 23  locally i can buy one for less than  2   if you like getting screwed buy from this seller nycpetsupply  
product	i expected my delivery to look like the photo  take a look at the photo  do you see chunks of fruit and nuts  well  when you get the bag  it will have them  but not like in this photo  it has a ton of filler  too many peanuts  which can harbor mold and bacteria and make your bird very ill  and a boat load of sunflower seeds  anyone with experience will know that sunflower seeds are taboo  i will not be buying this again  yes they like it  but humans also like mcdonalds 
quality	my dogs would not touch this once they smelled it  the treats were so hard that they would not even break when i tossed them against a brick wall 
health	made in china    not that she did not love it but she got sick     i will never buy anything made in china again<br  >regardless of some positive reviews       
health	made in china    not that she did not love it but she got sick     i will never buy anything made in china again<br  >regardless of some positive reviews       
health	made in china    not that she did not love it but she got sick     i will never buy anything made in china again<br  >regardless of some positive reviews       
quality	i threw away so many bowls of partially eaten product because my cat licks up the gravy and leaves the rest  for some reason  he did not even eat the beef gravy  so we are back to buying poultry types only 
product	we buy these all the time for our 2 goldens at costco  unfortunately  the quality of these do not measure up to the costco product  the sticks are much smaller skinnier  while my dogs ate them like malnourished wolves i could see the difference  thus  i will continue to by them there instead of the convenience of prime delivery 
quality	i gave it an ok product as i suppose it is good for some cats but my cat  fussy as she is  would not eat it  gave it to my cat sitter who also fosters homeless animals  she said the cats she has in her care did not much care for it but ate it anyway so it is not a bad product just not for my kitty 
product	does work but way to expensive  will keep dog inside and try some other item  vet recommended but there has to be some other way to keep cost down  i may not get another pet because it is just has expensive as a child to raise  it is a shame because i love my pets but cannot afford items such as this  they are loved and babied and make me really happy    but
quality	my 6 month old great pyrenees mix is a relentless chewer  i am always looking for safe chew toys that he cannot destroy in 10 minutes  the everlasting treat ball is a great concept and he took right to it  unfortunately  he had an extreme intestinal reaction to the treat  i checked the ingredients and i can see why that happened  his normal diet is grain free kibble  rice  and veggies   the first three ingredients are wheat gluten  gelatin  and  and glycerin  these are not good choices if your dog has a sensitive digestive system <br  ><br  >he also chewed off some of the soft plastic rim that holds the treat in place  he only had one session with the treat so i do not think it would have taken him long to render the holder unusable  i returned the treat ball and i continue to search for a safe  long lasting chew toy 
product	my dog loves this food  and i love ordering it from amazon  last time though  a couple of month s ago  i had the same experience as the other reviewers  i paid  52   and received 1 can of dog food  i called customer service  and they were wonderful  they said keep the can and they entered a new order for me  no kidding   two days later another can showed up  i called customer service  and she did figure out that the description is incorrect  it does not say case of 12  so she suggested we cancel the order and process a refund  she said she would get the description fixed so i could order again after that fix was made  unfortunately  it never got fixed so i cannot order 
product	does work but way to expensive  will keep dog inside and try some other item  vet recommended but there has to be some other way to keep cost down  i may not get another pet because it is just has expensive as a child to raise  it is a shame because i love my pets but cannot afford items such as this  they are loved and babied and make me really happy    but
product	i ordered this a few weeks ago and only just opened the packages  i have bought greenies for a long time now and have probably bought all sizes over the years <br  ><br  >even though i clearly ordered the petite size  and even though the box says petite  for some reason the sticks were clearly large sizes  it was a bit of an inconvenience 
product	this toy was advertised as \\ virtually indestructible \\  my 15 month old german shepherd had it in pieces in less than four hours  an expensive toy for that lack of durability  despite the company s description  might be okay for cocker sized dog  visually this is a cool and unusual toy 
quality	i wish they offered this in a tablet form  not encapsulated  <br  >using this in its scooper form  tends to be a little tedious when in a rush or basically having enough time to tend to it all  see below  <br  >my dog does not like this   34 on top  34  of his food  and therefore decides he would rather not eat his meal when noticed  even if it is a favored food  and or he is hungry  <br  >so  i have to blend puree his raw food diet  then sprinkle this on top  then mix it into his food well enough to disguise it the meal <br  >remember  he would be more than happy to eat his delicious raw foods as is  in their   34 solid  34  forms  but since it is now blended puree d  he is now thinking   34 ahh mann  i wish he did not feed me my food in this mushy way today  34     34 why cannot he just give it to me the way i usually like it  34  <br  >plus  i end up having to do wash more dishes since i had to use the blender  blades  top  body  extra spoon for scooping mixing  dog bowl     see there  it is just extra work  hence  the inconvenience <br  >when i have the extra time and energy to prepare his meals  it is not as much of a hassle <br  >but all in all  i we like the product  but just would rather have it in a pill  not encapsulated  form 
product	same as what other reviewer said  after being out of stock for months  it finally shipped  opened the relatively big box and there was only 1 biscuit  fortunately amazon refunded with no problems  my dog was happy to eat it 
quality	i have been buying this product from my vet  so i was overjoyed to see<br  >this product online and ordered 3 packages  thinking i do not need to carry heavy cans from the vet<br  >anymore  i was wrong <br  >when i opened the packages  my joy turned to disappointment  2 out of 3 cans were damaged <br  >some were dented to the rim <br  >i do not know if i can get refund as i broke seals and opened package  but i am sending them back<br  >anyway as i do not want to feed my cat from dented cans  knowing the risks of contamination <br  >what a waste 
quality	it seems like both the cats and the dogs were crazy for this stuff when i first got it   it has a distinctive odor   but the dogs do not like it much anymore  so i have a very large tub and no use   
product	purchased this product with high hopes  have a 750 gal pond with green water algae problem  used both pouches that came in box  after a few weeks no improvement at all  expensive item with poor result 
health	i purchased this product in hope that i would be able to fill it with   34 angel eyes  34  powder after seeing that you would be able to put liquid in them  i assumed powder would be no different  i was very wrong  the pocket is too small to put even 1 4 of his does in while spilling it trying  i also wrongfully assumed that this product would help prevent general allergy symptoms  like an allergy   34 vitamin  34   this product is for dogs that are allergic to the   34 regular  34  pill pockets  i gave it 2 stars because my dog loves them and even without medication is a good treat  they do smell really bad  i have to hold my breath just opening the resealable bag 
quality	my male cat is not a picky eater in the least  he loves to eat and he will eat just about anything   so i was really surprised that he would not touch any food that was mixed with the capsule contents  i have tried mixing it in all of his favorite meals and treats  including his favorite canned foods  tuna  tuna juice  tuna flakes  on his temptations treats  with his freeze dried raw food he adores  parmesan cheese  fortiflora  you name it   and literally every time he took the first taste of the mixture  he would make a weird licking face  walk away and mew for food  i have got 5 pills left  and am still battling the war with the fleas  so any new suggestions would definitely be appreciated 
health	my dogs loved it  but it does not last long at all  barely 4 uses before it was gone  it also gave both my critters loose stools  so nope 
quality	my dog loved this once he figured out how to use it  i added a rag to the inside to make it more difficult to get the food out  i was giving it to him to keep him occupied when i left the house  i kept finding the top off as he had managed to get it unscrewed  the last time he got it off he decided to chew it up  it is unusable now  i think it unscrews to easily and that is why it only got 3 stars 
product	i ordered two bags of the 3 4 inch knotted bones  both bags had the same labeling but one bag s bones were drastically smaller in thickness from the other  i measured and some of the smaller bones were just under 3 inches  i believe that if i ordered 2 3 inch bones  this is what i would receive  i will not return the product because technically  the bones are as described  but i am not buying loving pets nature s choice again due to inconsistent product sizes 
quality	i cannot speak to the quality of the treats  but i could not find any cats who would eat them  i offered the treats to five different cats  a couple of them sniffed at the treat a few times  most walked away almost immediately  no cat would try eating one 
quality	we get this with the subscribe and save service on a monthly basis and are typically happy with it  however  our last order came with one side banged up enough to have six of the cans opened and leaking  the food inside was unusable as it had actually turned gray  the cans were packed inside a larger box with other items that were not crushed in any way  the outer box arrived in perfect condition  this was disappointing because it means amazon packed it already damaged  cannot blame this one in ups  guys 
product	while the picture and the ad indicate that this is the original version of advantage  not advantage ii  what we received was the newer advantage ii with pyriproxyfen in it  not just imidacloprid like the original formula  our cat is extremely allergic to pyriproxyfen and we can t  therefore  use advantage ii <br  ><br  >i find this to be a completely unacceptable practice  to picture and describe an item and then to send another  this is not simply a mistake in shipping  the seller informed us that they do not carry the original  if they do not carry it  why would they then advertise otherwise <br  ><br  >you can clearly see what the ingredients are on the pic of the package  nowhere in the ad or product info do they mention advantage ii  in fact  the only place where advantage ii is mentioned is where  on the page  not a part of the product description  it says \\ there is a newer model of this item    \\ 
health	i would not get this for your dog  he was very anxious to eat it  however it splinters really bad  the shards were so sharp that it left blood in his stool  he even threw up some of it and the pieces were like little daggers  i have a 70lb pit bull that can handle a lot  but i would not recommend this for any dog 
quality	i am sure this is a good brand but my dog refuses to eat them    the smell is not all that great either lol my other dog on the other hand who will eat anything who does not require a grain free diet will gobble these right up 
quality	we bought these because our dog has a genetic disorder that causes his kneecap to pop out  since putting him on these the irritation has diminished  however  our dog eats most things but does not like these so we put them in peanut butter  i will try a different type the next time 
product	my amazon experience was great  the service and delivery was exceptional  my concern is that this product was made in china where there have been concerns about pet food made in china  i would love to see a product like this made in america as i would have greater confidence giving it to my pet 
product	i gave this to both my cat and my dog  had to force feed it   that should have been my first clue  followed the directions  then waited 24 hours  but no change  tried again the next day  and still no effect  maybe i got a \\ bad batch\\   but i am bummed about putting my pets through being forced to take a pill that did not do them any good  and about wasting the money 
product	what a load of crock   i did not mind paying twice the price of walmart or other local stores for home delivery but then they raised the price to over thirty dollars for nine dollars worth of cat litter and never notified me of the price jump   beware of subscribe and save  
health	my dogs did not like them they were too though and they choked on them too they were also alittle too dry as well not sure if it was the brand or not i have purchased duck jerky in the past and have not had a problem sorry but not happy
health	would not give this to my dog  because it contained chicken from china  it is been known that there was disease in china s chicken 
product	did not kill the fleas at all  will not buy it again  do not have anything else to say  this sucks  i should not have keep typing 
health	unfortunately  if you have a dog that does not chew things  like mine does  these may not be the best things to buy  i purchase the wellness food and biscuits  but these did not seem to digest well with my dog and he ended up getting sick and vomiting them back up   but could just be my dog too 
product	i read the mixed reviews but decided to purchase these after seeing the photographs  demonstrating the thickness of each stick nearing the diameter of a quarter  those pictures are inaccurate  the thickest stick in my package of seven was only 2 3 of the diameter of a quarter  see my picture for the cross section width of all seven sticks in my hand  compared to a quarter  my dog still likes the sticks  he could smell them through the package    but i can tell they are not going to last as long as others i have purchased on amazon  e g   red barn pack of two 12\\  sticks  <br  >bottom line  not thick  deceitful marketing  would not buy again 
product	i bought this hoping for a solution to the problem of wanting training treats at the dog park  where other dogs are not always well behaved or well supervised  this did not work well  the roller ball does not turn when licked  so the only way to use the product is to squeeze it and let the stuff drip  this makes it impossible to use indoors without dripping gravy like goo on your carpet  it also has a very unpleasant smell  it was a great idea in theory but in reality  quite disappointing 
quality	i thought i was getting a favorite flavor  sweet potato and turkey  it is a hard cookie that my dogs will not eat  lot of wasted money  but it may work well for other dogs 
health	it is summer time and my long haired cat is swallowing clumps of fur along with the sticker burs and beggars  lice he is covered in  in spite of all our efforts to clean him up  science diet hairball control cat food seemed to work effectively to keep the hair moving through his digestive system  but as a vegetarian i just could not stand the strong smell of the food 
quality	these are from china so who knows if they have toxins  my chickens do like them  i am not crazy about how dried out they are  when the chickens eat them they break into crumbs  if i knew what i know now i would have passed on this purchase 
health	the dogs liked this treat  but it left little bits of sticky residue all over the carpet and it got in the dogs fur  then one dog threw up and the other had an upset stomach  not a great product  at all  
product	dog likes the treat ok  but i got them as suggested by the busy buddy toys to put inside a food dispensing game it was \\ made for\\   the pieces are so tiny they flow out like sand and the brain puzzle is over after a few motions  do not buy unless you want to refill the toy every 10 seconds 
quality	too strong of a rubbery smell  and taste  i imagine   and too hard for a little puppy to figure out how to get the goodies out of it   and our puppy is actually pretty smart  maybe a small adult dog would enjoy it but like all the dog toys and chews  it is sort of a   34 crapshoot  34  as to what your dog will like  personal preference  for us they were a waste of money <br  ><br  >plus it gets weird looks from non dog owners who are not familiar with the kong line of dog toys  that is all i am going to say about that 
quality	i obviously have not eaten these treats  but neither have my kittens  they avoid these treats like the plague  i even tried sneaking a few in with their regular food and they still will not eat them 
quality	this box is massive  like it weighs more than my teeny tiny dog  i guess i did not really read that in the description  anyway  that was not the problem  my dog does not like them  and when he does eat one  he gets really gassy  it is not too great  we ended up giving them away  i could not bring myself to throw away 7 lbs of milkbones  now someone else s dog will be gassy 
quality	my two senior cats do not like it  they usually scarf up the gravy but barely touch this  mostly move it around the plate  maybe will try a different flavor next time 
quality	for the third time  i ordered these bully sticks for my 12 pound dog  the first lot smelled  but was fairly uniform in size  the second was half very thin sticks  this time  only four sticks were sizeable and the rest were so thin that my little dog can demolish one in less than an hour  the sticks were not longer than the small sticks originally purchased  the smell was so bad this time that it permeated the mailing envelope and caused my mailbox to stink  really  i will not order from this company again 
product	it is very expensive but  what are you going to do  you cannot feed them crickets all the time  just do not mix a lot or it will just go to waste 
product	this is a really made product and smells good  it looks like the perfect product for my dog  unfortunately  she does not really like the taste of it  when i throw it on the floor  it is safe from being eaten by my schnauzer  now and then my cat will peck away at it but i must admit even that is half heartedly  i must be a really nutritional product because my dog turns up her nose at it 
product	ok   so this is another item you would hope  based on the good reviews and overall practicality of the item  would work as it is intended to  i have to say i was rather disappointed when i took the bottle with me in my bag and it leaked all over  the only way this bottle does not leak is when it is standing upright  which defeats the purpose of the bottle as being travel friendly <br  ><br  >in addition  i used the bowl a total of 10 times before it started falling apart   the plastic seams started tearing and i eventually had to throw it away since it was no longer useful <br  ><br  >i would invest a little more money into an actual gulpy  which probably holds up better  and a high quality collapsible bowl 
product	i purchased this for our very active border collie mix puppy  he loves rolling it around for the food  the only problem is it is hard plastic and it is really loud when it rolls around on the floor  not only does the food make a lot of noise when it rolls around  but the ball itself hitting our hardwood floors or on the tile is quite annoying  so we do not use it anymore 
quality	i have had this product for a couple weeks now  when it first arrived i put in some cat treats  my 10 and 8 year old cats were interested in getting the treats out  one of them got one of the treats out of the easy part but after trying the other levels they both gave up and let the rest of the treats stay so i moved them to the easy part  they were not interested  i did notice that the younger cat would take her paw out after trying to get a treat and then would lick it as if she were hurting it  the next morning the cat amazing was upside down on the floor  during the day i caught one of the cats just pushing it around on the floor with her nose  trying to get her nose in to get a treat  it was comical watching her  i tried putting little toy mice inside to peak their interest  they look inside  but that is it  unless my cats change their attitude  i will be giving it to my son for his cats  maybe they will have more interest 
product	i was told that this was a great toy to keep a dog entertained  however  my dog had little interest in it and cannot get the treats to come out of the hole  i think that the hole is too far up on the toy  i would not buy this toy again or would probably try a smaller version of it 
health	as my title states  these 2 dog treat bones are not high quality  but really  you probably already knew that  and my dog only chewed on it twice  the first time only took a sliver off of the bone and then the second time only ate about 3 4 of an inch  it is now been almost 5 months and he has not touched it since  i am going to throw it away  ugh <br  ><br  >pro  it is a good size for a yorkie  7 8 pounds  to chew on occasionally <br  ><br  >cons  ingredients   wheat starch  potential allergen   powdered cellulose  harsh on bowels  could be crushed peanut hulls  possibly contains recycled cardboard  cheap filler   chicken powder  all the leftover chicken parts that human grade meat factories toss and then grind up and cook fully then make into a powder such as tumors  diseased organs  bones  feathers  feet  beaks      soy flour  potential allergen  <br  ><br  >from the nylabone website <br  >ingredients<br  >wheat starch  glycerin  powdered cellulose  lecithin  potato starch  chicken powder  roast beef flavor  natural bacon flavor  natural flavor  oat fiber  calcium carbonate  soy flour and rosemary oil  vitamins  thiamin  riboflavin  pantothenic acid  vitamin b 6  folic acid  vitamin a  vitamin e  biotin  choline  inositol and paba  minerals  calcium carbonate  ferrous carbonate  magnesium oxide  dicalcium phosphate  potassium chloride  sodium selenite  calcium chloride  zinc oxide  copper oxide  manganese oxide and sodium molybdate <br  ><br  >analysis<br  >min  crude protein  1   min  crude fat  0 5   max  crude fiber  8   max  moisture  15   min  calcium  0 1 
health	one case of food was great  no problems  the 2nd case had hidden dented cans in it that my dog would not eat  so far  my dog has refused to eat four cans out of the case  all of the cans are labeled with acceptable dates but  you can tell the difference in the smell etc  it is obvious that i paid for old outdated  unhealthy dog food  yes  it is a better price but you roll the dice with amazon 
quality	i feed halo spot s stew to my dog and he loves it  he eats anything but sniffs this and will not touch it  i am very disappointed and the wasted money i spent
quality	i have long been a royal canin fan  i have used their indoor cat food for a decade or more  i am only so so on this dog food though  my dog likes the taste quite a bit  it has nice large kibbles that are good for a golden  but i do not like that it is not wheat free  wheat can be very inflammatory and this seems problematic to me in a breed known for their susceptibility to arthritis  i bought this when i could not get my regular brand  now fresh large breed  and i feel fine using it in a pinch but will go back to my regular brand when the bag is done 
product	my dog is allergic to everything food except venison and potato  i ordered this and did not realize it has fish oil   bad for her 
product	this product is supposed to be a phosphorus binder  helping animals with renal issues to not absorb  and kidneys have to process  phosphorus from food consumed  this made no difference at all with my cat  vendor was prompt and product was packaged well  just did not make a difference for us 
health	i am not sure that they actually do what they say they do  that is clean your pets teeth  but then they do not do any harm either and my dogs love them 
product	dogs did not like these treats  they sounded good  i am not buying anything for my dogs made in china 
quality	now i am stuck with boxes and boxes of treats my dog cannot eat   the main ingredient is flour <br  >the item is non returnable   very dissapointed
health	worked perfect  just what we needed for one very sick pup <br  >would highly recommend this product to everyone with pets 
quality	this is basically a good deal  but the greenies seemed to be a little old   dried out compared to what i have gotten at the pet store  pricewise it is a great deal if your dog does not notice the difference in the freshness of the greenies  unfortunately  my dog definitely notices 
health	nice low caloric load but gave one of the cats loose stool  he gets that way with anything with a lot of fiber  they ate it ok though and i liked the kibble size for their old teeth
product	i have purchased this 6 pack before  and the product itself was fine  it shipped quickly and i did not experience any problems with spoiling as other purchasers did  however  this is not the best price on amazon  you would think that buying in bulk would save  but at  39 99 for 6 you are paying  6 67 for each packet  right now  the individual packages are priced at  5 99 on amazon  both products are the same size and flavor and come with free shipping 
product	you get about 3 pounds of chicken feet in one box  picture shows 100 boxes and description states 25 lb shipping weight  shame on you petsupplies com for misleading and scamming   you and your ilk give businesses a bad name 
quality	my cat loves both fresh is best freeze dried chicken hearts and their duck hearts but he will not touch these or the beef rounds  and i do not blame him  the hearts feel a bit like jerky  but these rounds have the consistency of those environmentally friendly packing peanuts  i have tried rehydrating them but no luck  it is a real shame because the ingredients are great but something has been lost by grinding up the meat and reconstituting it  definitely will not be buying again 
health	i ordered the medium size for my 33 pound corgi  and it was so small i feared he would choke on it  so i never even gave it to him  i would consider this size more like a small  definite waste of  10 here 
quality	as i have ordered the fish sticks manufactured by this company and my dog loves them i thought the fish jerky would be a bit different to try  they are very hard and my dog does not like them at all 
product	this stuff does not seem to work as well as it used to  it lasts now for like 7 days then i have to retreat my dogs <br  >the delivery to my home was quick as always from this seller and i have always ordered from this seller 
product	i have ordered twice   just a little too pricey for pooch  he loves his bully sticks more he takes these and buries in the yard  not good  62 
quality	i receive barkbox  a monthly subscription with new products for my st bernard each month  the most recent one contained a stuffed shin bone  which he loved  i ordered these and the stuff in the middle was all dried out and basically fell out  defeating part of the purpose of the bone  to keep him entertained and want to get the stuff in the middle out  i can only guess that they were really old and the stuff inside dried up completely and shrank  not very happy with this purchase 
product	ordered 3 eight ounce bags  sent back as they were brittle   requested an exchange   they were worst than the first three   did not send back   tossed in trash and went to petsmart and got fresh product for my pet will not buy products for my pet from amazon again 
quality	my tiny maltese finds this too hard       could be she is also too spoiled  she does not chew it and we end up throwing away the pieces 
product	the picture posted here for this product shows a box for a 36 count regular size box  once you pay and place the order  you will find that an 18 count bag is being sent to you instead  the picture and the title \\ regular size\\  gives you the impression that the regular size is referring to the description greenies uses to match the treat with the size of the dog  again  visible in the picture   but believe it is a shady way for this company to try to get away with a bait and switch scam  they are using the regular size to refer to the number of treats  regular size vs value size   but again there is no indication of that until after the purchase is made  i will be rejecting the package and requesting a refund 
quality	i ordered two items and both were not fresh<br  >i have bought these products on the store level and i know what they are fresh<br  >these products while a white sticker dated them to expire later this year it was a lie <br  >the were hard and brittle and dried out <br  >shame on you  
health	the product looks good  but my cats are not too fund of it  i think it may be a matter of getting them used to it if they can have only lamb  if allergies dictate 
quality	i searched for freeze dried chicken for cats and this is the product that came up  i ordered two bags    without looking at the picture closely and seeing that the bag said dog treats  i discovered that when my order arrived  however  freeze dried chicken must be the same for cats and dogs so i started feeding it to my cats  the only difference i discovered were the pieces are bigger  however  i also discovered many pieces of bone in the chicken    impossible to eat  so i have to go through each piece and crumble it up to be sure there is not any bone it in <br  ><br  >i ve just received the actual \\ cat\\  version of this treat and i am hoping i do not find bones again 
product	these came with little brown bugs  do not know what kind of bugs  but they were in the unopened packages  they were dead  but i did not take a chance and threw both packages away  the product says it is made in china but safety tested in the us  i guess they did not find the bugs 
quality	just like a baby who likes carrots one day and two days later will only eat peas  my cats like classic style one day and the next would not touch it at all  they do seem to enjoy fancy feast over every other brand i have tried  in general i am happy with it and i will just keep rotating it  that is the only reason i gave it three stars 
product	when this arrived the giggle noise maker did not work  it would elicit a pathetic squeak every now and then     it did not really matter though as it ended up in the trash within 5 minutes since my dog started tearing small pieces off it very quickly  definitely not a rugged toy for an active chewer  despite what the description might say  is your dog has a history of chewing and destroying toys quickly  look elsewhere 
quality	they smell kind of soapy or something  my dog has turned his nose up at them for weeks  but normally loves rawhide  so i am confident there is something unappealing about these  he did finally eat one when i forgot to give him breakfast and he got really hungry  so i know he can eat them  but it is not much a of a treat  i guess 
health	my pup has intense car sickness anxiety   she drools waterfalls upon even seeing the car and occasionally vomits  i bought the thundershirt after seeing firsthand how it saved a friend s dog from tearing up the house during thunderstorms <br  ><br  >unfortunately  it did nothing for my girl s car issues  i do not even put it on anymore because she kept throwing up on it <br  ><br  >maybe i will try it again when she is older 
quality	it was  okay  when i was mixing it with her regular non vegan cat food  but now that i have switched her over to just this food  she is not eating  i have heard that the other flavor  green can  is better  and i did try feeding her that flavor before and she ate it  unfortunately  i stupidly ordered a whole half case of this flavor that she does not like  will try the green can again  gourmet entree  and if that does not work  we may have to go back to her non vegan canned food     
product	my cat prefers friskies shreds or other forms  she is not overly fond of pate   however i cannot get anything but the pate for delivery 
product	i have a very picky 3 year old yorkie  she is very insistent on eating what  when  and where she wants  after hearing much praise from family about royal canin  i purchased a bag here to see if i could finally find a kibble my dog enjoys  unfortunately  she hated it  and only ate 2 or 3 pieces  i contacted royal canin but never received a response <br  ><br  >3 5 stars due to family still praising this food  unfortunately  it was just an expensive test for my yorkie  who is now happily enjoying a local dog food with fresh ingredients 
quality	my dog loves bully sticks but he will not touch these  i have left them out in several places and he bypasses them for anything else  not sure my dog is being picky but he is never turned his nose up at a bully stick before 
product	this is a nicely made item  we were just disappointed that it was smaller than we were expecting <br  >arrived quickly and the shipping process was great 
quality	my girls are typically very picky eaters as it is  but my friend s dog will eat anything   and i mean anything  however  with one whiff of these jerky strips  he turned his head and walked away  i cannot blame the dog  the consistency is rubbery and weird  i finally had to throw the bag away  never again 
product	my dog loves carob and i have purchased these for him locally and they are no longer available so i ordered them online  they were in a sturdy cardboard mailing box but half of the cookies were still crushed  he is still eating them and loves the taste  just wish they were more suited to shipping so they could arrive in better condition 
quality	my cats liked the way they smell but did not eat i gave them to my mom in law for her dog hard to know if he likes them he usually tries and buries his treats lol 
product	i really like the smaller cans  it is for my 18 year old cat who seems to have uti s every few years thus far  the thing is she is not really crazy about this food    so i can only give it to her every few days and she does eat it  i think from everything i have read online that this food is probably the best of the lot  anyway  she is doing good so far  
quality	my dog had some moose antlers that she loved  so i thought i would try these  i guess they are the size stated  but they are much smaller than i thought they would be  unfortunately  she does not care for them   
health	i bought this for my puppy that can not chew great  they are just plain liver so i do not have to worry as much about him getting sick  these worked great for him and this is such a larger container that we still have not run out after a month and we treat him alot   going pee  crating  sitting  laying  just being good   i have found that the beef liver is alot bigger chunks than the chicken  i find that i can break up the large pieces that way it lasts even longer and he does not need to chew it for a long period of time  i think that these are great for training  they do have a smell  i do not really like it but its not offensive  my husband actually likes the small  we bought the 21 oz container and it sure in big  i keep already broken pieces in a baggy so we do not have to have the large container out  the treats do cost alot but you also get alot when you buy the larger containers  i think that for as long as they last and the quality they are worth the money 
health	it is possible that its great for older cats but i have a 2 month old kitten and her head got stuck in one of the holes while she was playing so she started freaking out and i had to rip it open on the second day i had it  there is a tiny disclosure that said to watch out for smaller cars but i saw it after the whole incident  i think that should be clearer with bigger typo because it could be dangerous to leave a kitten unattended with this toy which was the whole intention of keeping her busy while i was away 
product	i was so upset to find out that these were made in china  it says it right there on the bag but nowhere on the description on the site  my dogs loves them but i am trying to stay from the china made treats 
health	this spray did not work  it did quite the opposite  after applying twice my cats skin became very red and crusty  she even started limping from the pain  i took her the vet who gave her antibiotics and a different shampoo which her redness disappeared after three days  she is very normal now  after a  300 vet visit  this just added to the expense and put her in pain 
product	i have been purchasing these bully sticks for the past year or so  they were great in the begiining and now they are not worth the money  they have been super thin in size and almost hollow  my 13 lbs dog at this in one day  not to mention the price has pretty much doubled in a year 
quality	the cats do not like this flavor much  i think the problem is the consistency  not sure why it is different than the regular flavor  but it is 
health	we have one fussy cat and one any garbage will do cat  neither of them would eat these when placed in front of her  the fussy one ate them when my husband put them underneath some treats she already liked  she then promptly threw up 
product	my dog loves these   but read the ad carefully you only get 1  4oz package  for 4 99  you can get the same package at pet smart for  1 99
health	we have two cats  and noticed a single flea on the cat whose fur is mostly white  upon close inspection  we literally saw only the one flea  we found no sign of fleas on the other cat  from that  we surmised that we did not have a serious flea problem  still  we wanted to deal with the flea s  we had so the problem did not get any worse <br  ><br  >we opened the capsules and sprinkled the medicine on some wet for for the cats  and they ate it quite readily  one of the cats did not seem to tolerate the medicine well  and threw up the medicated food one a couple of occasions  perhaps because of that  this medicine did not seem to work for the cat in question  who continued to have that one flea until my daughter was able to pluck it off and kill it <br  ><br  >so unfortunately  this did not seem to work for us  i have used little city dogs  vanilla worm medicine to great success in the past  so i will try other products from them should the need arise 
quality	would have given zero one star <br  >the description does not say where these are made  as it should   the first three shipments i received were made in the usa  the next two were made in china  due to questionable quality practices  large number of pet food recalls for high levels of toxins and salmonella  i will not give my dog food or treats made in china <br  ><br  >would have given five stars <br  >my dog loves these when used with the starmark toys  hours of fun for my pit mix puppy 
health	cat has early stage kidney disease so this product was a lucky find  hard to find low phosphorus treats  cat enjoyed the treats but one package was not properly sealed and the contents spilled out  i would have given more stars but i do not know how they could have missed that one package was open 
health	this product states it is chicken  but it also contains beef  our dog has a severe beef allergy and these made her violently ill and vomit  shame on milo s for blatantly advertising this product as  a pure chicken treat  when the 3rd ingredient is beef  stay away 
quality	the dogs like it fine  i do not like that upon opening the product a high percentage of the cookies were broken and crumbly 
product	i have purchased this item frequently over the years but this time the liver bits were fractured and mostly too small to handle  using treats for dog training requires bits that can be held in the hand and fed  if they are too big or too small it is hard or impossible to work it  perhaps i got a bad batch but about 20  of the container was \\ powder\\  while another 30  was too small to hold  about half the bin was useful  win some  lose some  this was a loss 
health	this reminds me of letting little kids lay on the floor and suck on jawbreakers  cut off ends of bully sticks  i guess  i paid for them so i will let my dogs eat them  but i do worry about them choking 
product	gives her gas out this world  it is almost creepy  she will sneak into any room you are in  fart and walk off  leaving all of us to suffer the repercussions of being a little cheap this month on dog food     i m will not buy this again 
product	our corgi will eat anything   and i literally mean anything   pinecones  dryer lint  sponges  carpet fringe   but he is not really sold on these which is surprising because they seem to be very healthy and smell about the same as every other dog treat he eats <br  ><br  >lisa<br  >fresh eggs daily<br  >www fresh eggs daily com
health	i got my cat s ibs under control by adding probiotics  formulated for people  to her food  when i saw that purina was making a product specifically for cats  i bought it right away <br  ><br  >but  my cat threw up immediately upon on ingesting this  just to be sure  i gave it to her again  and my normally healthy cat threw up again  i should have read the ingredients first    i would have seen that it is mostly animal digest  i could not believe it  now i give her probiotics for people and she is healthy once again  shame on you  purina 
quality	my chihuahuas will not touch these  my shih tzu took it and put it in the corner a week ago and has not went back to it  no one seems to l ike them 
quality	my chihuahuas ate the crust off of these bones then did not touch the bone again  so  the bones are just l aying around 
quality	my cat loves almost any kind of food   very non picky  or so i thought  he will not touch these and will eat around them if i try to put them in w his food   
product	this package was dated 2010  too old    need to be current so the active ingredients will work and be effective 
health	after seeing rave reviews for this treat i assumed that my dogs would go nuts over the stuff  the  strips  arrived in a very large plastic bag  it was much larger than i originally anticipated   the bag is resealable  which keeps the treats fresh and dry  i love that feature with all dog treats <br  ><br  >the treats themselves look like very thick strips of bacon  but are in no way actually bacon  i knew by reading reviews ahead of time that these were not very healthy  but i thought  if my dogs like them  they are worth buying for a sweet treat   when i opened the bag i was very caught off gaurd by the smell  i assumed they would smell like bacon  but rather they smelled like molasses  which i assume is one of the more flavorful ingredients in this snack  when i looked through the ingredients i was very disappointed  most of the main ingredients were comprised of corn  very unhealthy for dogs    and the only  meat  item i saw was bacon fat  not even entirely real bacon <br  ><br  >even so  i was eager to see if my dogs thought they were something special  i have many dogs  mostly sleddogs  and a chihuahua  for the most part they are not picky eaters  but none of them seemed thrilled with these at all  i offered all six dogs two peices  none of them eagerly took them  most of them simply sniffed them and then walked away  the ones that did decide to try them  dropped them off the ground after munching a few peices down  i was expecting my dogs to go wild for these  but they just    seemed uninterested  my dogs typically get pig ears  rawhide chews  and milkbones as snacks  they love all of those things quite a bit  but they seemed less than thrilled with these snacks <br  ><br  >the thick strips are ideal for larger dog breeds  they were not sized appropriately for my chihuahua  so ultimately i opted out of letting him try them  his jaw just is not quite strong enough to gnaw them down  the larger dogs though  could easily eat them if they wanted to <br  ><br  >the pros  a very big bag  very affordable  and they are sized perfectly for large dogs <br  ><br  >the cons  the ingredients are very poor and unhealthy  the dogs just did not seem thrilled with them   s  a very big bag  very affordable  and they are sized perfectly for large dogs <br  ><br  >the cons  the ingredients are very poor and unhealthy  the dogs just did not seem thrilled with them   
quality	my dogs do not like this  shame  it looks like a great treat made in usa <br  >three of my three dogs smell the treat and turn away  lol
health	money was an issue  the reviews were good so i bought this  unfortunately i did not have the same experience as the favorable reviewers  my cats do not like it and they got upset stomachs  many more hairballs than usual  that being said  it is spring  it appears to be vitamin fortified and the price was excellent 
product	my dog loves these so i ordered this larger size because it included a canister  well  i never received the canister  i only received two bags  very disappointed  buyer beware 
product	i purchased this system as a gift for my daughter  her request   a friend of hers had praised the system  unfortunately  her cat was not able to adapt to the pellets that come with the box  the first day  he refused to pee in the box  instead he peed on her couch  he had never done this before   the next day  he finally peed in the box  but refused to poop in it  instead he began pooping in her bathtub  whenever i would bring him back to our home  where his two litter boxes were filled with standard litter  he was fine   pooped and peed in his boxes  no problem  when he returned to her home  she added standard litter on top of the pellets  thinking that would help  he pooped in the tub again  she moved the litter box to another room  he still refused to poop in it  it is an expensive system  so we are really disappointed it did not work out for us   maybe we are the exception and not the norm 
product	since my dog cannot tolerate the taste of this product it is not effective  for dogs that can tolerate the taste this might work but i cannot tell  it is a bit pricey so if you think you want to use this system i would try to find the smallest and cheapest sample and see if your dog can tolerate the taste first 
product	the capsules were kind of clunky  and i had to take them apart to give to the cats  or try to    i think i had it wrapped up in chicken and bacon and they still would not get near it  or not much nice idea but needs a better delivery system  pricey 
product	but not as good  you can tell the difference just looking at them and smelling them  do not remember the original size of package  i know the size of their dry dog food packages keep shrinking 
product	i have nothing against tidy cat   it is the litter i choose to use  i have these on subscribe and save   and the last delivery one of the containers were open inside of the box  before i noticed it  i carried it in my front door and into my kitchen  then i realized that litter was leaking out the bottom of the box  i had it in my carpet and all over my floors   not fun  i will bet there was 1 2 of a container that had spilled out between the origin of this product and my house  poor ups driver <br  ><br  >it s my fault for not really paying attention to the weight when i placed the original order   but it might help others to realize these are much smaller containers than the big ones in the stores 
health	this stuff literally smells like vomit  but hey  dogs will eat their own vomit  so getting them to eat it may not be a problem  my dog ate it without flinching   he is not finicky <br  ><br  >my advice  unless you really need something that is allergen free for the dog  avoid this flavor and go with beef or chicken <br  ><br  >i cannot wait until it is all used up 
quality	i am new to buying stainless steel dishes for my cats  but i can see why some websites say it gives the food a metallic taste  because this plate sure stinks  i washed it about 10 times before first using it and that made it smell a little better  but my cats would not eat off of it and i’m sure it’s because of the smell  i did order some stainless steel bowls as well  from a different maker  and they did not stink like this plate does  i did not have a problem with the sticker  it came right off  but this plate sure stinks  yuck 
quality	these are good for my 2 month old puppy to chew on  the only thing i do not like is that it unravels into two pieces  i do not like it and neither does my puppy  once she unravels it she does not want to chew it anymore  i am actually not going to buy them again  i think i am going to flat rawhides 
product	i bought this for my cat as shown in the picture  it is too big and too heavy for a cat to move it around although my cat is large and loves treats  might work for dogs but certainly not for cats  so here it sits useless  my cat sits next to it knowing it has treats in it but hard to work it  i bought instead one of the round balls that have a single hole and my cat loves that and rolls it on the floor to get the treats out 
product	this product seemed flimsy and very hard for my dog to remove the yellow treat covers  i got the brick also  and my pup loves it 
product	the jug is very hard to separate from the base  it can be messy if not completely empty  the plastic is very cheap and flimsy  i do not see this lasting very long 
product	  asin b000sqk3qw cadet gourmet pet treats duck breast fillets  32 ounce  not only does amazon not indicate that this product is made in china  the seller actually puts a label over the part of the packaging that says it is made in china  i should have looked at other people s reviews but did not  i am very upset that amazon will not allow me to return this product and feel that amazon should be responsible for letting buyers know  up front in their description  that it is made in china  i would never feed my dog anything made in china    i apparently have to give this item at least one star or i cannot submit the review but it is really a zero star 
quality	i do not like it since my cat does not like it  he is interested at first  but after a few bites  not anymore 
quality	it is an ok product and does what it says it will do but the 6 cats we have  have no interest in it what so ever 
product	my dog seeems to like this  but i am just okay with it  little annoyances like no flip top  fat in can  looks and smells like dog food  makes it not a favorite  but  in a pinch i will get it again  in the realm of premium  high priced  dog food it is reasonably priced 
product	these balls with the treat disks had been my 2 dogs  favorite treat toys until a few weeks ago when one of them  a healthy 4 year old shih tzu  suddenly developed kidney failure  while trying to determine possible causes  our vet asked whether she had eaten any treats from china  given all the problems  including kidney failure  that have been attributed to chinese treats  especially those containing wheat gluten  we have not given our dogs treats from china for at least the past two years  luckily my dog recovered after a week in icu  but i am even more wary of treats made in china than before <br  ><br  >i had always thought of the treat ball as more of a toy until a few days ago when one of them needed a new disk  i looked at the package and was horrified to see that the treat inserts are in fact made in china  i immediately called the company and was assured that each batch of treats is tested for melamine  salmonella  etc  when i asked what lab does their testing i was told  \\ oh  the testing is done at a lab in china \\ <br  ><br  >i told the representative that since the refill disks were made  and tested  in china we would no longer be a customer  after trying to sell me on how safe the chinese disks are  the representative then informed me that they also make a usa made alternative disk that also fits the treat ball  the usa made inserts are called dental treat disks and are shaped differently on the top  i am glad that a usa made refill is available  but i find it strange that starmark would develop an almost identical usa made refill if the chinese made refill is so perfect  i am going to purchase some of the usa made refills provided the ingredients are also from the usa 
quality	cat would not eat it  so i broke the capsule apart and put on tuna fish  they some  but took 2 days for them to finish it 
product	i bought this for my pitt bull  thinking it would be good for her as she is a really big dog  let me tell you  this thing is humongous  i think its a whole cow leg  she could not pick it up  and what is worse  it left stains and crumbs everywhere  as soon as i opened the package it fell apart  this indefinably needs to be an outside treat but make sure you open it and keep it on something because it gets everywhere  and worse  if you leave it outside  the smell attracts critters  but you do not want it in your house  trust me  i wound up having to throw it away the morning after i gave it to her  what a waste  but  she liked what she could get of it  so that is why it gets two stars  one from me  and one from my happy dog on christmas when she got to open her huge treat  the look on her face did kind of make the purchase worth it 
quality	like other reviewers  we received a barkworthies bone in our april bark box and my dogs loved it so much i went on amazon to order 3 more  unfortunately  the bones we received were much smaller  one was cracked  almost 1 2 of the length of the bone  and the filling on all of them is so dried out that it wiggles inside the bone   the only thing keeping it inside the bone at this point is the wrapper  i plan to return these because they are nothing like the large  fresh quality bone we received in our april bark box  not sure why the quality is so dramatically different 
product	the second the bag was opened the dogs started drooling   at least i know that they like the flavor but after half a dozen per dog i do not really see a difference  i am hoping by the end of the bag maybe some of the bad breath will be gone 
product	my little girl is a picky eater  she will turn her head and maybe eat it much later  or not  i will not buy any more 
quality	i do not know why my little one does not like it  but usually it sits around for days until she might eat it or i toss it 
quality	i bought this with great hopes  but unfortunately the dog does not like it  wish i would bought a smaller bag first  as for price and delivery  that was just fine  as amazon always is  what a convenience to have it delivered  too 
product	i bought 2 small and 2 large toys thinking they would be good for my dogs and for using with clients  dogs  i was very disappointed to find that even the small was almost too large for my labs  my dogs did play with them but they are made of hard plastic  not rubber and i found my male dog starting to chew up the top portion so i took it away immediately  i would not ever let them play with these unattended  i shipped the large ones back  they were so large you would need a mastiff to handle them  i would not buy them again 
product	i am so disappointed with this purchase and upset that amazon s description of this product is blatantly false  these treats are not vegan as they contain gelatin  note to amazon  the fact that it does not contain animal   34 by product meal  34  does not mean that the treat does not contain animal ingredients  i did not think i had to verify amazon s statement that this product is   34 vegan  34   but i happened to check out the ingredient list only after opening and giving my dog one of the treats  needless to say  i am horrified to have supported a product made through animal suffering and i want my money back 
health	my dog was getting sick  and i could not figure it out  i used to just reach into the package  and give her a treat  today  i decided to actually look at the treat  covered in mold and rot  i bought these a month ago  i am so angry at this point  i do not even know what to do  do not buy  your dog will get sick                           
quality	not good  my pets does not like them   they are like biscuits or some sort of crackers with a bit of duck flavour
quality	my dog will not eat this brand chicken feet  they do not come in jars  they come in packages <br  >i would look for another brand 
product	item arrived shattered in tons of pieces and was not even correct item in the box  was the last one so could not get it exchanged  money was refunded but it was supposed to be a gift  big hassle 
health	i used this product daily for 10 days and it never killed the fleas on my dog  i bathed my dog in flea shampoo before beginning the 10 days and the flea shampoo was more effective than the product  i also followed up and used the rest of the capsules and still fleas  my home and yard had already been sprayed so i do not feel that my dog was reinfected 
health	i am a professional dog trainer and recently learned that the rollerball of the lickety stik can pop out of the bottle  i know of two people who have had this happen  both dogs swallowed the ball  one of the dogs needed emergency surgery and the other dog fortunately vomited the ball  many dogs will try to bite the top of the bottle before they figure out how to lick it  and if they bite it just so  the ball will pop out  i will never recommend or use this product again 
product	ordered item  had been oos for the longest  finally got email to receive when packaged arrived it contained one single dog biscuit  the biscuit is about 2 inches wide by 4 5 inches long  small treat for a big dog  looked liked a an oatmeal cookie for a dog 
product	although it did shoot the treats  for small treats they all just spill out so i would recommend getting bigger treats to try to shoot but i have a small dog  i thought this would be fun but my dog does not understand where they are going and i thought it would shoot out from the barrel like a fake gun  but it shoots out of the top part which is kind of strange 
quality	i purchased this for my clownfish  goby  and damsel and they do not like it  it comes out of the package in a glob and quickly sinks to the bottom and the hermit crabs end up eating it 
product	this was ridiculous  what arrived was not a 2 piece or 2 pack  it was also not 3 to 4 inches long  it was a single piece of bone  a bit over two inches long—perhaps 2 1 2 would be pushing it  the thin plastic wrap was not a good seal around the product <br  ><br  >it might have been a five dollar treat at the grocery story  certainly not worth the price charged here  you will want to avoid this disappointment 
quality	my cat is not fond of these at all  i think they are over priced and over rated  he much prefers friskies party mix or friskies crispies  cat treats are so expensive and these crumble into little pieces that he just lets go to waste  it is difficult to rate these products as cats seem to have different tastes  but i would not recommend temptations because my cat much prefers friskies brand treats 
quality	i thought  what a great deal  but i found myself sniffing floors carpet furniture because i thought my puppy had an accident  then i picked this bully stick up and out to the back yard it went  if i recall right  it smelled before i opened package  i have wrapped this package with aluminum foil and double bagged it  to the garage it goes  so if you are not a sensitive smeller  these will be great 
product	i bought this for my dog that has anxiety issues  as recommended by a trainer   he was chewing the plastic the second time i gave it to him  i opened the hole as large as it would go so that he could easily get the food out  that still did not work  maybe my pooch is not all that smart   was just frustrated    oh well  guess i will have to try something else 
product	i have been using the 45 count nutro greenies pill pockets for about 4 years now  since one of my cats has feline hypothyroidism and requires one 2 5 mg tablet of felimazole twice a day  i have used all three flavors   salmon  chicken and beef  but she never did like the beef <br  ><br  >while a great product  i am giving them 2 stars  as nutro has slowly been making greenies smaller over the years  also  they are not staying as fresh as long anymore  i contacted nutro  who provided this response <br  ><br  >\\ thank you for taking the time to contact the nutro company  our products carry a 100  satisfaction guarantee  you may return your product to the place of purchase for a refund  credit  or exchange  if you need assistance  please call the number below <br  ><br  >the nutro company is committed to developing quality products which meet your pet s nutritional needs  your confidence in our products and continued goodwill are very important to us  please give us a call at 1 866 greenies  monday through friday  between the hours of 8 00 a m  and 4 30 p m  central standard time if you would like additional information  sincerely <br  ><br  >the nutro company<br  >consumer relations   corporate affairs<br  >1 866 greenies\\ <br  ><br  >i called them and explained my dissatisfaction  but all they did was apologize  i would think they would have at least offered up some coupons or something  but no dice  so  zero stars for nutro customer service <br  ><br  >if i can find a suitable substitution  i will switch 
quality	my dog would not eat them  gave them to my mother  and her dogs would not eat them  she gave them to a friend who has dogs that eat everything  occasionally even actual garbage   they would not eat them    i feel bad about a product when several different animals will not even give them a nibble 
product	large bulk boxes moldy  my dogs love these but the last batch i had of three bulk had a greenish cast in areas which i saw was mold  some had much greenish gray mold <br  >called amazon  and as usual  they refunded my money asap and were great to work with <br  >i do not know if this was  one time problem or not
product	i have bought these in stores in small bags  but the treats in these big bags i received were very hard  my dog is small and could not really enjoy them   
quality	i bought these for my grandfather s cats  which he has three of  i know two of them had problems with their teeth from plaque buildup so i thought this would help  one showed no interest at all  another licked it for a bit and walked away  the last one did chew on it for a while  but then batted it around <br  ><br  >i tried breaking into parts so it would be easier for them chew on  but it was to hard to even do that  no wonder the cats did not like it 
quality	undisputed is the superiority of stainless steel for pet feeding dishes  i personally favor the durapet dishes  but i ordered the molor dishes based on a review claiming cats do not like their whiskers to touch the sides of bowls  since my cats tend to remove food from their dishes and eat from the floor  i thought the reviewer s claim to be a testable hypothesis <br  ><br  >alas    these   34 plate style  34  feeding dishes did not change that behavior one iota  my cats still find their food to be tastier after they personally remove from the dish  so much for the cats  review <br  ><br  >my review  the gauge quality of the stainless on the molor feeding dishes does not even come close to durapet dishes  which i still see as top of the line  further  application of the non skid material on the molor dish bottom is sloppy and untrimmed relative to the durapet 
quality	this products caused a massive amount of rashes to appear on one of my dogs  i tried to serve it three times and the poor pup got rashes each time  the dog eats other dehydrated foods with oats so that cannot be the ingredient causing the issue  this leaves wheat germ as the culprit  though most people  including myself  believe wheat germ is the safe part of wheat  the fact is its still wheat  dogs should not eat wheat  the end <br  ><br  >on the plus side its nice that nrg uses dehydrated meat in the ingredient list which means that it is the true weight of the meat and that its placement in the ingredient list is accurate in the final product 
quality	i have to give them to the squirrels  because my 2 love  my lil gentlemen doggies will not eat them   <br  >which is surprising  since they luv cheeses <br  >yuk 
product	my dog loves these  but they smell up the whole house while he is chewing on them  other than the odor problem  they are fine  good price and good packaging and delivery 
product	they push a few marigolds up against the clear portion of the packaging and that ladies and gentlemen are all of the marigolds in the whole bag  waste of money  and a company as established as kaytee should be ashamed of treating their loyal customer base that way 
quality	i gave this 3 stars because although my neighbors dogs will eat it  mine won t  they appear to be overly dried out   not sure if perhaps they are old  but my boys just will not eat them  and they love chicken jerky 
quality	the positive reviewers must have dogs with jaws and teeth of steel because these small treats are way too hard for my dog  it takes him many tries to bite into it 
product	i rescued a toy poodle and she has no teeth  i feed her canned foods because of the softness and was feeding her things like vienna sausages as a treat but i do not want all the sodium and crap in the canned meats to be a regular part of her diet so i looked on amazon for a healthy soft treat  these may be healthy but they are not for a toothless toy dog at all  she sniffed and was not even interested in the smell and it is not something you can just tear bits off of  she is been given the pup peroni cheese treats and she loves them but they are not really healthy  any suggestions for my rescue would be welcomed 
quality	i cannot comment on whether or not the maze works because it will be returned without being used  there is no reason to believe that it will not slow down a dog s feeding  but i do not care for the design <br  ><br  >this dog feeder requires the dog to move the food onto the floor to eat it  we do not want dog food all over our kitchen floor and do not want to encourage our dog to scatter food on the floor  those who do not mind dog food on the floor may well like this design 
quality	i recently bought a bag of rc yorshire terrier 28 formula based on the high recommendations and reviews  unfortunately  the pellets are so hard that my dogs cannot break them up  my 10lb yorkie can barely crack the pellets and my 5lb yorkie just gave up  i have to soak them or break them up and breaking them up is even hard for me since they are so hard  they look good  smell good  and the ingredients are excellent  but they are just too  too hard to chew  my first and last bag  too bad because i really like the ingredients and thought it would be a good switch from their previous dry food 
product	you know the price at 11 95 for that size was excellent and i bought 5 packages  however  i do not think i will be ordering it again because i just got an email from you offering the same product and packaging for  14 34 so i will not be ordering it again <br  ><br  >thanks
product	the duck treats that i usually purchase were made in china and have been linked to deaths of dogs   via the news  they actually smell like meat   my dogs were never hesitant to grab those and eat them  but  these do not even smell good  therefore  neither of my dogs would even try them  i laid one down in front of my beagle    he moved away from the treat  so disappointed    
product	i believe i misintrepreted the post   thought it was six 3 lb packages but it was only one 3lb     i could have bought this at stop and shop for  3 99    almost sent it back but it would have ccost me the same  12 in return shipping   otherwise my gerbil loves this stuff
product	you would think jerky would be moist  but this is dry and hard  the chews i received were almost black and did not look or feel meaty like what the package shows 
product	so i got this hoping it would be a food source for my fish that they could graze on  but it is a pasty mush that does not hold together in my tank at all  does not stick to rocks or glass  and my fish would barely touch the stuff  not too happy with this product and will not buy more 
product	considering that our bt loves bully sticks  we were very disappointed that she did not like the flakes  we were looking for an enticement to get her to eat good food  she would not even eat the flakes by themselves <br  >an overpriced mistake    
health	my dog initially liked these however they caused him stomach issues and i decided they were not for him so i donated them to the local shelter  my opinion do not waste your money if i could give it 1 2 star i would
product	my 40 pound female can eat this in ten minutes  it does not last   34 hours  34  as the product description says  i admit my dog is a crazy  machine like  chewer and can destroy anything  this just is not worth it for us 
product	my cats can take or leave this food  i buy it to mix with their pricier food  to extend it <br  >and my cats do like a  blend  of different kibbles  they eat it  unfortunately  i will not be buying<br  >this from amazon anymore  the package states  19 99 all over it  amazon currently has<br  >it listed for  37 and then advertises \\ free shipping\\  for it  ok       
product	i was very upset to see that all 4 bags that i ordered were all just a bunch of crushed up pieces inside  the box that received them in was not crushed  it seemed securely packed  i would not recommend this to a friend  the product is a great product  my little dog loves them 
health	these are a little small  and will try the pill variety next i did not realize this flavor was for pups with allergies  so i cannot comment on that aspect of the product  but  my god do these pill pockets smell something awful  just opening the bag makes my kitchen stink like terrible farts  despite this  my dog did not seem to care and gobbled her pill down like a good little patient  love the product  but definitely trying a different flavor 
health	i ordered these   34 soft and chewy  34  bones because my 12 yr old golden cannot chew anything hard anymore  partly due to age and partly due to the nasal tumor she has  i was so excited as the prospect of giving her a bone she could enjoy without help from me breaking it up  i am so disappointed  these bones are so hard  i cannot even break one in half with my hands  i had to use a hammer to smash it into pieces small enough for her to eat  they might taste good  but they are not soft and chewy as advertised  buyer beware 
quality	they are nice pieces and everything but they have a smoked type flavor smell and my dogs will not eat them at all 
product	the 3 stars is because of the small size vs  the relative high price  i do not  however  scrimp when ordering treats for my dogs after experiencing a problem with treats made in a foreign country  fortunately  everyone came out ok  the pieces are very small  my dogs like a treat that they can carry off and work on for awhile   there is an odd odor each time you open the package  i think it is a combination of dried chicken and the herbs used in drying  both scotties like the product  they literally woof it down  the size of the piece is more a reward and training aid in our household  i have purchased several brands of chicken jerky of late with the focus only on made in america or canada and made with trackable american products  i do give this an excellent review for the actual product  but the cost factor eliminates this product from our shopping list 
quality	again the cats liked it at first as time went on they {3 cats are 11  1 is 1yr old  they refused to eat it
quality	my dog did not care fr these bars he just walked away from them  i do not know if it was the small<br  >or the taste 
product	bones are definitely 3 to 4 inches  in hindsight  i do not think it is a great value at 70  cents a bone  but it is not overly expensive either 
quality	our cat just licked the gravy and did not touch the   34 meat  34   we switched to whiskas pate  which she devours 
quality	after all this time i still have all of these  my cat will not eat them  the will litteraly leave them on the floor forever if i do not pick them up 
health	this may be good food for cats with diminished kidney function  unfortunately it seems that it cannot be shipped without denting the cans  in my case 23 of the 24 cans were dented on their sides  apparently the package was subjected to a fairly significant lateral force at some point during shipping  a dent in the can usually does not mean that the food has been exposed to air and become spoiled  but if all the cans are always dented the odds of eventually getting one that this has happened to become too great to be acceptable  i am keeping the case i recieved and carefully checking each can for any indication of spoilage but i doubt i will be ordering any more  the food itself seems ok although i have had to mix it with some sheba brand to get my cats to eat it  cats with kidney problems have poor appetites to start with and it seems that all the foods meant to help the problem are not very tasty to them either  having tasted it myself i would have to agree   the cost of the hi tor is at least less than prescription kidney diets  whether or not it actually helps delay the deterioration of the kidneys is a guessing game  i am not aware of any clinical trials that have been conducted with this particular food  since it supposedly has low protien and phosphorous like the clinically tested prescription foods  though not as low  one would have to guess it does help some  if it could be shipped without denting the cans i might have tried more 
health	i put the advantix ii on my jack russell yesterday afternoon and he began acting very oddly within an hour  he is normally very friendly and \\ bouncy\\  and he was walking strangely and hiding  today he was worse    shaking and his back legs were wobbly    his back was arched  hunched  as if he was in a lot of pain  i called my vet who told me to bathe him in dawn liquid asap and to never use this on him again  i read up on the internet and some dogs have even died from this  my dog seems fine now that he had his bath    but what a scare 
health	i have a german shepherd with food allergies so i was delighted to find this at my local petco  and he would eat it  but reluctantly  the ingredients listed are good  and it did not make him itchy  so it earned 3 stars  but none of my dogs ever really liked it <br  ><br  >even my chow hound of a retriever mix did not like this food too much  and would sniff it and look at me before consuming it  it does have an extremely strong smoke flavoring smell and it makes me wonder if they are trying to cover something up  or if they really believe it ads to the appeal  if they cut back on the liquid smoke maybe it would be more palateable  i dunno <br  ><br  >in summary  i would buy a couple cans if i ran out of my current prescription diet i use  but i will not be buying it by the case any more  it is good in a pinch but my dogs are much happier with a different brand 
health	our cats have eaten this same flavor for years and not had a problem  recently i ordered a 24 pack that seems to have something wrong  within hours of eating  our cats have vomited  i was not sure what the issue was  but when we alternated with a different flavor  they did not vomit  when we returned to this  they vomited again  does not seem to be a coincidence 
quality	i got a great deal on this  but was somehow unaware that these particular mar o snacks were sized for large dogs over 50 pounds  my little lhasa apso loves the smaller version  but does not like these too much  i think i will have to donate the other 4 boxes to needy pets 
product	not impressed with this product  anyone who has given their dog a bully stick knows that size matters  har har   stout dense sticks will keep the dog busy longer  unfortunately  most of the sticks in this pack are tiny thin things that the dog goes through in less than 10 minutes  there were maybe 3 good dense sticks in there  the rest are crap  i would not buy this again 
product	i have struggled with purchasing   34 odor free  34  bully sticks on amazon  the first was a braided bully stick that was supposedly odor free  yet when i opened the envelope the stench nearly knocked me over  that one was returned  this one was my second order  and i purchased it because most of the reviews said it was odor free  not so  i cut it up into thirds to give to my tiny pooch and she sat next to me  chewing away happily   but i was nearly gagging from the smell  seriously it smelled like a pile of manure  not a subtle scent at all    i was forced to go around the corner and buy some extremely overpriced chewies for my pup for a trip tonight  do not buy unless you want your home to smell like a barn  i will not be purchasing any more bully sticks online   
quality	the problem i found was that it looks good  smells good  and has  what seems to be  a nice gravy or sauce  it seems to have a large amount of  some kind of  filler  small rectangular  grayish product  comprising  perhaps  half the serving  my cat would not eat this  even crushed and mashed  she would not eat much  i even used stick blender on prduct  right out ofthe can  then she would not eat it at all <br  ><br  >classic  minced  all the way  she licks bowl clean 
product	this product was labeled 3 flavor grilled variety pack  beef  chicken turkey   however  it was all seafood mix  tuna  salmon <br  >oddly enough  my cats love the beef   fowl dishes  but they hate fish  therefore  because it was not as advertised  it is virtually useless to me 
health	works pretty good not bad for the price  but my dog still had infection and i wound up spending     on a vet
health	for cats with chronic kidney disease  the addition of chitosan is essential to help bind phosphorus  thus preventing further damage to their marginally functioning kidneys  we had been using another brand  but were intrigued with renal powder because its ingredients include potassium citrate  that seemed such a wise addition since kitties with ckd are drinking and voiding much water  and for that reason supplementing with potassium is an important consideration  sad to say  renal powder is so bitter  several of us tasted it  compared to our previous brand  epakitin   our cat agreed  and even rejected his favorite foods when the tiniest amount was mixed in  we are going back to epakitin and will re start the chicken flavored potassium supplements  wedgewood pharmacy   note  potassium is notoriously bitter and requires clever disguise 
product	returnable i would have never signed on   the food was in  shreds  and  bits  i have an older outdoor cat who needs to eat only the  pate  kind of catfood  so this was a learning experience  an expensive one  for me 
product	we purchased this for snorkeling in the caribbean  the fish were not at all attracted to it  and it was a complete waste of money  we have used products like this in the past that were highly effective  so we were extremely disappointed  other problems are that this fish food is reasonably heavy to carry around  and the packaging is so flimsy  that several of the wrappers had come apart before we even opened our package  so a lot of the fish food was scattered around and wasted 
quality	my dog did not like this product at all  i have bought other products from this company but unfortuanetly this one he did not care for 
quality	seems to be the same as the much pricier prescription foods for kitties with kidney trouble  my cat does not like it very much  it certainly looks and smells unappetizing to me   so i do not blame her   but she has not liked any of the prescription brands either  she was never a picky eater until we had to start giving her the specialized renal foods   both wet and dry  she ends up eating the hi tor neo diet rather than going hungry so i guess that makes it a good alternative for far less money  i just wish they would find a way to make it more appealing flavorful 
health	while i have generally used kaytee ferret foods in the past  i am very disappointed in this formula  i thought because of all the  pro health  hype  it was a big improvement from the  regular   gives my ferret diarrhea  no fun for either one of us 
product	we have hardwood floors  this is very loud rolling around  do not buy unless you have carpet  hardwood floors  use kong products 
product	the problem with these \\ training treats\\  are that you cannot use them frequently due to the dog getting tired of the  probably bland  flavor  they worked for a couple of hours and then my dog just lost interest  they are too expensive to consider buying again  especially since my dog does not go crazy for them  for a training treat to be effective  it needs to really entice your dog  i have taken to chopping these   asin b000633v48 natural balance dog food  turkey formula  4 pound roll   up into small pieces  they are much more cost effective and my dog scarfs them down 
health	my 10lb mini schnauzer swallowed the entire bone in less than a minute  i love zukes products  especially their little treats but this one is dangerous and too small even for a small dog 
product	i am not sure about the product  i just got it yeaterday  but i am really upset and will never buy this product from you again  at the same time i ordered it  i cancelled it   along with two other products and both the other products were cancelled and did not bill my card  but you ignored this product and billed me and i also had to pay 7 00 for shipping and handling  i order lots of itims through amazon and never experienced this before  i called and spoke to someone on the phone and she said that there is nothing she could do about it     it is not fair that this happened to me and i think someone should make things right or i will not shop through amazon any longer  thank you  janet abbott
product	the description for this product lists this bag as being 8 ounces  so i ordered several  i received several 1 1 ounce bags of the item  for almost 10 dollars  it is not worth it for this tiny sized bag  we have purchased the larger sized bag for about 10 in store  so that is what i expected to receive  i am waiting for amazon to call me back to either refund my money and change the description on the site or to send me the size that they advertise <br  ><br  >that said  my finicky cat loves these treats  he ll sit next to his food bowl in the evening until someone gives him his dream treat <br  ><br  >update  amazon sent out another order of this  and surprise  they sent more of the 1 ounce bags  obviously  the description on this page needs to be updated  the 1 1 ounce bags are only a couple of dollars at our retail pet store and the large bag that they carry is approximately the cost that amazon charges for these <br  ><br  >if amazon does so  would someone leave a comment for me so i can update this review  thanks   
product	my guy always loved them and now i can just pick up at front door instead of driving to pet   smart and still save money<br  ><br  >update 04 30 2013 <br  >hasn t really done any wonders  in terms of cleaning  even after using them for almost 6months  it might help keep the teeth clean after a dentist visit  i have not noticed any huge advantage of using these except that they they are a good size treat for my labrador <br  ><br  >i m finally giving up on these to help maintain good oral health  i would consider them way too expensive for treats <br  ><br  >i would give it 4 stars as treats  <br  >about 2 stars for oral care<br  >so i would average it out to 3 stars    
product	wow  was i disappointed  my silver bills only like the small round seed  and rarely eat anything else  sometimes that worries me because i am afraid they are not getting enough to eat  i have been buying the 3lb finch seed from walmart and decided i needed something better for them  they do get vitamins and treats  etc <br  ><br  >when i received this 2 lb package purchased from amazon   not amazon s fault     i was shocked when i received it  held it up right next to the walmart bag and realized they are the same mix of seeds  paid a lot more for it here on amazon too  i paid more for this 2lb bag than i did for a 3 lb bag from walmart <br  ><br  >i cancelled my subscription  
quality	have used zuke s as training aids for my dogs going on 5 years now  hoped this dried product would be a good substitute  i do not know if it is the flavor i chose  but the dogs will not go near them 
health	my 3 dogs eat this  i guess they like it  they do not have vomiting  diarrhea  seizures  tremors  fevers  after eating it 
health	they eat it  do not vomit or  have seizures  tremors  bleeding from the mouth or gum  impotence or diarrhea  dogs like it 
product	i bought one bottle  did not make any difference  you would have to buy many bottles of this stuff to get results  it is expensive  i decided to give my dog coconut oil and better dog food  he seems to do very well on this  
health	this could be specific to my dog  but he snarfs these down really fast  too fast  and then starts to hack and gag on the last 1 4 of a bone  he ends up trying to swallow it and then coughing it back up and finishing it that way  it is really unnerving and i worry he will get a large piece of it lodged somewhere internally  he has had diarrhea as a result of these bones at least one time  again  this could be specific to my dog  boston terrier 
product	my dog likes it  but i found it over dried  it is not as jewable as jerky  i will not buy it anymore
product	these bones were way to small  it would be good for a dog 10lb or less  if you have a 60lb dog or bigger do not buy 
health	my dogs just love these however these are very stale  just opening the package you can smell it  i never had problems with these in the past but lately i am starting to question if the dog treats chews are even checked for freshness and or expiration dates  i want to add that i also purchased these from a pet store with the same issue all of this happening within the last 3 months  i have thrown these out  will not throw good money after bad having to return them  please review your products so our pets do not get sick 
quality	my cats love it  but i think that it is too big for cats  my cats could not eat without cut  so i have to cut them to small pieces  it is eary to cut it  but it is trouble some to do it everytime 
quality	the product arrived quickly  and i opened it to give the dogs some treats  and the stink  like ammonia  was overwhelming  looking in the bag saw the problem was mold  lots of it  almost all of the treats were covered with mold  we have been giving salmon treats to our dogs for a long time  and the 2 1 2 pound bag looked like a good deal  not  by the way  surprisingly the date code on the bag indicated the product would be good until 2015  returned to amazon  quickly received refund  wait till they get the treats and open them up 
product	i have used this product in the past and it always worked immediately and the flea problem was nipped in the bud right away  this seemed to work for a week and then my cats were all scratching again  sure enough  they all had fleas  very disappointed that i spent  50 for nothing 
quality	my cat who is normally a little piggie about food will not touch these  my dog is happy to eat them though  the ingredient list includes soy protein  corn and wheat  normally i would not order anything with grain in it for my cat but the amazon page did not give the ingredient list  normally i do not give these grains to my dog either  but one bag will not kill him 
product	i thought it was a joke when it arrived and i opened the package  small 4 to 5 inch long thin piece of  tripe  34   chew  in addition my dogs are all over any thing tripe and they turned there noises up at these  they are still floating around there chews 2 plus weeks later 
product	i guess it is not the toy s fault that my dog cannot figure out how to play with it  we have not had much success with this treat dispenser  my dog just has not gotten the hang of it yet  it is awkward to try to get food in it though since you have to hold the top part upside down then try to screw on the bottom  but because it is so heavy it is kind of tricky  it is loud too and i do not really like it rolling around on my wood floors anyway but i think maybe when the weather gets nicer i can get my dog to play with it outside and it will keep him occupied in the backyard for awhile 
quality	giving it 3 stars just because my cat is not fond of any seafood flavor  it was delivered timely and good price but unfortunately i cannot order it again due to my cat s fussy nature 
quality	i ordered this because i was unable to find the duck tenders my little yorkie loves so much but they neither look or smell good and my dog did not like them at all  they do not even look like duck or meat  i really have no idea what they look like  i think they look more like dry treats  they are really strange  i would nt recommend them to anyone  greatly disappointed  
product	i have four cats who picked up fleas from a visiting dog friend  over the past year i have bought and used advantage ii on all four of them multiple times  this is what i observed <br  >the fleas die almost immediately  they stay away for about a week  then they return <br  ><br  >now mind you  every time i used this flea treatment  i also combed the cats after a day or two with a flea comb to remove all flea ish residue from their fur  i purged the house of any flea eggs by washing cat beds  putting pillows through the dryer  vacuuming and throwing away the bag  putting borax along the baseboards  and yet  the fleas returned <br  ><br  >advantage is supposed to work for a month   i have not found this to be true  it is a heavy duty chemical that is probably not really good for cats  so it is not advisable to use it over and over again  basically  after having bought this product about 5 times  not cheap   i find it actually just does not work  i have since started using those flea pills along with my flea purging procedure and finally have a handle on the cursed fleas 
quality	the box came with the platic liner fully opened and the biscuits stale and hard as a rock  it is my dog s favorite biscuit and he will not touch these   and he has no problem with stale food   makes me wonder if these are the real thing  avoid 
quality	put in the everlasting treats into the treat ball and my dog samson goes nuts for hours  rolling playing kicking and eating his treats <br  ><br  >pros <br  >my dog loves this toy treat combo <br  >it keeps him actively running around happy <br  >hes not able to pry them out so he cannot eat it all at once <br  ><br  >cons <br  >full of starches and other not so good for your dog ingredients <br  ><br  >overall i love this for a once a month treat  but if your overly worried about your dogs diet i would move onto a different treat such as pet  n shape chik  n rice balls dog treats  which can also be put into the ball 
quality	my dog would not eat this  shes spoiled but i just could not get her to try it  i know it would be good for her if she would eat it but just sitting ine sack is not helping anyone 
health	i use a no needle syringe to administer this to a sick cat  she really disliked the taste  i thought it smelled like motor oil and was too runny to use unless chilled in the fridge first  mixing it into food just made her reject the food 
health	tried it  the dogs seemed to like it  the nozzle is awful   very cheap bottle and when you pump it  the nozzle swivels and makes a mess  pouring the smelly oil every except where you intended it to go  it smells fishy and does not come out of clothes after said mess  worst part is two of my dogs vomited it up and then refused to eat their food with this so i know the cause  so much for ordering a product based on all the rave reviews 
health	stay away from this garbage  so far there has been no blood as other reviews have said  but i am so afraid  nothing can replace brushing a dog s teeth  and as far as chewing for any benefit  stick to bully sticks  in the trash they go 
product	as soon as i opened this product i could tell that it was old stock because it was very  very dry  i e mail amazon and was issued a complete refund and was told to throw the package in the garbage <br  >this is the reason i deal with amazon com  the few complaints that i had have been setted quickly 
quality	i originally started my puppy on castor and pollux which i love the ingredients but my boston terrier had loose stills no matter what i tried  once i switched to science diet he got a lot better  i do not like the ingredients at all and do eventually plan on mixing it with castor and pollux and swithing 100  and hopefully everything goes well <br  >my boston does not get excited about this food at all  he eats it because he is hungry  but he actually loved castor and pollux 
product	i have used this product many times over the last 5 1 2 years and never had any problem  it has always worked great  i bought it on amazon to save money  as i did  thank you  as soon as i received it  i put it on  i did everything else needed to be done also  2 weeks later i needed to reapply  never had to do that before  that was a week ago and there is still scratching    i am not sure if it is because of where it is stored or d m just received a bad batch  but the advantage ii was not 100  effective as i am use to <br  >disappointed the product is not working   <br  >03 15 2013 update    my cat now has tapeworm and is still itchy  have to have them all checked  but very disappointed  i thought i was saving money  but it will cost me much more than if i went to the vet first 
health	thought it would nourish my sick cat but she would not touch it  maybe that is because she never was a milk drinker  i ended up giving it to her with a syringe 
quality	my cat loves it  he is a very picky cat and does not like many cat foods  felix is very happy 
quality	i bought these for my two ferrets  my more picky ferret sniffed it and walked away  my other ferret will pick them up and hide them  she may have eaten a few  but they really do not like them much 
product	i was very disappointed in this product   it took about 2 minutes for my dog to eat the   34 healthy edibles  34  
quality	i cannot really say why the cats do not like it  it looks good  it smells good  they just do not care for it  i will probably continue to use the case i have and if they stop eating it entirely  give it to the spca  it is too bad  like i said  it seems like a good product  but the cats just do not particularly like it 
product	my dog does not enjoy his dry food as much as he used to  we started mixing it with about a tablespoon of canned food and a little bit of hot water to make a sort of gravy  and he perked right back up  this made feeding him morning and night a bit of a hassle  though  we had to take the canned food out of the fridge  add it to the dry food  add water  mix  and put the canned food back in the freezer bag we use to store it  when i heard about petchup  i thought this would relieve all of the extra steps  i now just dispense the dry food  add the petchup with its handy flip top  still stored in the fridge   mix  and give to the dog  no water or wasteful fridge packaging required  the dog likes it almost as much as the canned food  so that part is fine  my only concern is that a typical can of good dog food  about  1 50  would generally get us through about a week  this stuff   8 30  is about halfway gone  and it is only been about a week and a half  that means the whole bottle will last about 3 weeks  the old way we did it is definitely economically more practical  but this stuff is so much easier <br  ><br  >also  the hole at the top of this bottle is huge  way bigger than the size of a ketchup or mustard condiment dispenser hole  and this stuff is not very viscous  this means that as soon as you flip it over  it starts pouring out  probably also contributing to the excess use  i am thinking the 17 ounce bottle makes it more economical than   asin b000mbo4li iams savory sauce for adult dogs roasted beef flavor  11 ounce bottles pack of 9     too  but i wonder if the packaging of that stuff is better  it is probably what i will try next and let everyone know  as of now  i think i may go back to the canned food and use this on mornings when i am running late or in a rush  for people not too concerned about the cost  this is great stuff  it is definitely dog approved in our house 
quality	i purchased these in hopes of having a way to redirect a young cat who likes to chew pencils  pens  and power cords <br  >if the ingredients had been listed online  i would have kept looking for other options <br  ><br  >the ingredient listing on the back of the bag reads  soy protein concentrate  wheat gluten  gelatin  corn gluten meal  chicken meal  and taurine <br  ><br  >the soy  corn  and wheat are all very common allergens for cats  often resulting in skin problems or gastrointestinal problems  while i did not expect this product to be grain free  i was surprised at the sheer quantity of grains and fillers in these \\ treats <br  ><br  >in addition  the bag identifies the manufacturer as \\ natural polymer international corp \\   which means the wheat  corn  and soy products are almost certainly coming from overseas and possibly not from a company with pets at heart  not so long ago  there were serious contamination issues resulting in pets dying from low quality  contaminated pet food fillers from china <br  ><br  >while it probably still beats eating pencils  i would prefer to find a healthier  safer option for our cat 
quality	i have three cats who love their treats but run away from these  even my hungry dog who will eat most anything will not touch them 
quality	it is my fault  i ordered the wrong thing  my dogs would not eat them so i gave them to the local animal shelter
quality	the beef formula has changed <br  ><br  >they used to be soft and pliable and i could easily hide her medicine in them and she ate them instantly  now they crumble as they are not as soft  i checked the new product date and it stated \\ best before\\  oct 27th 2014 <br  ><br  >the first 5 ingredients has change from beef  ground rice  ground oats  malted barley  gelatin  to beef  potatoes  tapioca  vegetables glycerin  gelatin <br  ><br  >the new recipe also includes rosemary  turmeric  and sage that the old one does not have  the new formula has also removed the ground flax seeds that the old one had  lastly  the ingredients on the old recipe states fresh apples  fresh carrots  fresh blueberries  and the new recipe states apples  carrots  blueberries <br  ><br  >i had a few of the old style and gave her one without any medicine and she ate it right away  i then gave her the new style without any medicine and she sniffed at it then turned her head and she was not interested  i put it in her dog dish and it is still sitting there <br  ><br  >some dog may like the newer formula but little daisy does not  and i had no idea that the formula had changed  i reorder without reading any reviews because she loved the taste but it appears others have experienced the same thing <br  ><br  >
health	the dog i got it for  come to find out  had a bacterial infection associated with etherialtropic lymphoa  skin cancer so this product did not seem to affect his skin condition one way or the other  he did seem to like the taste though  we had to put him down this past monday    
quality	i used to always order this dog food from amazon  yet when the price went up very quickly i found another site that shipped for free and the packaging was always intact as well the food from this place is actually fresh  the food i get from amazon shipments is dull in color and lighter  it is just not fresh and i can tell from my dog when he uses the bathroom something is not right <br  >i will not be ordering food anymore from amazon  or his treats the treats  same brand  come crushed all the time 
quality	my portuguese water dog  ate this in 20 minutes  it is not worth the money  i expected that like yak cheese the dog would chew on it for quite a while  not eat it in 20 minutes  this was a waste of my money 
quality	i bought this bones based on the recommendations and as soon as i showed it to my puppy  she smelled and walked away  i have left them out for her  but she has never touched them  waste of my money 
quality	my boxer who chews everything would not touch it  not sure why  never could get him intrested in the product 
quality	i would not recommend this product  my dog hated the taste  will not be buying these again  gave him an upset tummy as well 
quality	mr fussy  caique parrot  is very particular about his food   i have tried different things  pellets etc  and he is not interested in most of them  however he does eat power treats  after dunking it in water  so i consider this a minor success  each   34 treat  34  is a small compressed cube  he likes to pick it up with his foot and munch on it  he definitely prefers this to   34 harrison s organic pepper lifetime coarse  34  which he will not touch <br  >since this is a   34 treat  34  and not a   34 food  34  it is recommended to give up to 3 per day  for medium sized birds   a bag will probably last you a while  however the harrison s website says   34 can be used as the only food source to aid in weaning  changing a bird’s diet from seeds to harrison’s bird foods or as a supplement for birds already fed harrison’s bird foods that need extra energy following an illness  34 <br  >the good <br  >  has lots of good ingredients  including brazilian red palm fruit oil   montmorillonite clay   parrots in the wild eat clay and it is thought to have a beneficial effect <br  >the bad <br  >  not sure why exactly this is so hard   it is a compressed cube  i would imagine most birds would have to eat this   34 wet  34  in order to consume it otherwise it may crumble into powder  personally i feel a somewhat softer cube would be better  this is especially true since the potential for birds dropping a wet slippery cube is high  resulting in food wastage   if your bird does not eat this or does not   34 dunk  34  it in water you should try slightly moistening with water to see if that helps <br  ><br  >overall it is seems to be a good product as long as your bird eats it  and if you are a bird owner you know that is the true test of bird food    unlike other harrisons  product this only comes in one product size  small cubes    there is no   34 small large  34  issues or   34 am i buying the right one   34  <br  >also note that according to harrisons it is not advised to store this in another container   supposedly the package has been designed to keep it fresh longer  it has a zip lock type reusable seal  <br  >i hope you have found this useful 
health	let me start by saying that my cats have never shown any problems with anything i have fed them  they have absolutely no health problems or shown any adverse reaction to any kind of food  also i will not comment on ingredients and nutrition because i would not really know what i was talking about  just some empirical observations <br  ><br  >i was feeding my cats \\ chicken soup for the cat lover s soul\\  and decided to give the purina one a shot because i was getting tied of paying the higher price for the chicken soup <br  ><br  >the cats ignore the purina one if i give them a bowl of each <br  ><br  >the cats go through exactly twice as many bowls of purina one compared to the chicken soup  free feeders   leads me to believe they need more of the purina to get their daily nutrition  regardless  the cheaper purina one is costing me more money because my cats go through so much more of it 
quality	my dog would not eat any of treats she is very picky gave them to my daughter for her two dogs and she said they ate them  
quality	it came in on time  we gave it to our cat who does not like any kind of capsules administered to him  we got it just to make sure that all the fleas were gone  at this time he is flea free so i guess it does what it suppose to do 
product	unfortunately the ball they are supposed to go in is a cheap rubber ball that any dog will rip apart  rendering overpriced treats pretty much worthless 
health	let me start by describing who these chews were for  i have a 13 week old  20 pound female rottweiler who is playful and a chewer   as most puppies are <br  ><br  >the hard puppy nylabone was not holding her interest  probably because she could not make much progress on it so i decided to try something that she could actually put a dent in  and eat it while she was at it  i will admit that when i purchased these  i did not realize that the description said \\ petite\\   but i figured \\ hey  my puppy is still a puppy  it will be fine\\   while they were  fine  in the sense that she enjoyed it and did not make her sick  it did not achieve my goal in keeping her occupied because they only lasted a few short minutes  i have found that the nylabone regular flexible puppy bone works well for her right now   asin b0002asmsk nylabone puppybone teething chew toy  regular   but i am still looking for an edible puppy bone that last more then a few minutes  i just ordered the non petite version and we will see how those stand up  i will update when we test those out <br  ><br  >2 19 2013 update <br  >okay so i just tried out the \\ regular\\  size healthy edibles and they did last longer then the petites  one bone kept my pup occupied for almost an hour   she took a little break about half way into it     although she does seem to prefer the bacon flavor over the lamb and apple ones <br  ><br  >click \\ yes\\  if this helped  and send me a comment if it did not   
product	for the price i paid  this is ok  the velcro strip allows me to strap it onto a belted pair of pants but the clip does not hold  and constantly comes off  as mentioned in other reviews   it is somewhat annoying  the pouch does hold the treats and i have not had issues getting the treats out  the drawstring holds the treats in well  the utility of the pouch is limited for me as the clip malfunctions every single time and comes off from where i clip it onto my pants and i may just use this to hold treats for car rides etc <br  ><br  >next time  i would probably pay a little more and buy one that is a flat pouch with a belt that goes around my waist  cannot complain though  since it was very cost effective 
product	buyer beware  there are very few treats in the package  i did not notice the size and paid a similar price in a store for a 7 oz package  my dog likes them but amazon has terrible prices on this product 
quality	i have multiple cats and one would eat this 24 hours a day if i let her  the rest just will not go near it  they walk away after sniffing it 
quality	my bengal cat tried it for the first time but after the first can  she will not eat this anymore  she sniffs it and that is about it  her favorite is the blue buffalo wilderness chicken <br  ><br  >here is a list of the recipes she tried  all canned by the way  blue buffalo brand <br  ><br  >  blue buffalo wilderness chicken   her favorite<br  >  blue buffalo healthy gourmet sliced chicken entrée   her favorite as well<br  >  blue buffalo healthy gourmet flaked tuna entrée   ate it few times and now simply sniffs it and that is it <br  >  blue buffalo healthy gourmet flaked turkey entrée   ate it once and now simply sniffs it and that is it<br  >  blue buffalo wilderness salmon   she likes it  every once in a while  the texture is very runny but a nice change to lap the meal with a salmon flavor<br  >  blue buffalo wilderness turkey   she likes it  every once in a while  the texture is very runny  just like the salmon recipe  i do not buy this anymore as she prefers the salmon if wanting to lap the meal<br  >  blue buffalo wilderness duck   they changed the recipe and now she only prefers this once a week or even less  before they changed the recipe  it was her favorite 
quality	december 6  2012 – the food and drug administration is warning pet owners and caretakers not to feed their animals certain lots of nature’s deli chicken jerky dog treats because they may be contaminated with salmonella bacteria <br  >the affected products include packages with a lot code of bestby061913den <br  >today’s fda warning is an expansion of the recall posted by the dog food advisor in early october <br  >the treats are made and distributed in the u  s  by kasel associates industries inc  and were sold at costco stores in the denver  colorado area <br  >although kasel has declined to perform a voluntary recall at this time  costco is working with fda and has removed all of the affected products from its shelves 
product	after using this product  my dog began acting strange  panic filled  shaking  and runing from place to place  in short frantic bursts  panting and shaking  he stopped responding to verbal commands  and would not get off the bed without physically pulling him  while he screamed like we were ripping his fur off  i wish i would have read the comments in the recomendation files  we started washing him with dawn to reduce the toxic effects  and it helped  but tho he is better now  he is not the same dog  do not buy this product 
quality	i have a pure bred persian and she only licks the gravy off the little shredded chunks of fake   34 meat  34  in the cans but never eats the rest of the stuff  which looks like fake meat to me  i feel i am wasting more than half the money i pay for this  but she seems to like the gravy a lot  this is the only reason i continue to buy it  if fancy feast makes some other cat food with only the gravy that she will eat all of  i would not mind paying more for it  as i throw away all the chunks of   34 meat  34  she will not eat after licking all the gravy off it 
quality	this product sounded great and arrived quickly  my dog loved the sweet potato treats i had bought previously so i thought he would love these  i was wrong  even though the texture was very similar to what he would been wolfing down  he turned his nose up on these  very disappointing  but who can argue with a dog  he will eat what he wants  and no amount of reasoning will change his mind  i gave one to the neighbor s dog who is at our house all the time  and he practically ate my hand looking for more  i guess my dog is just finicky 
product	this package is no larger than a bag of m   m s you would get out of a vending machine  it contains 4 6 treats  for the price  this is not a good bargain  also  it took a long than usual time for such a tiny package to get to me  6 days  while the dogs liked the treat  they look and feel like meat styrofoam  i wias extremely disappointed 
health	i gave these drops a 1 star rating only because they are fairly inexpensive  the fact that they are cheaper than a vet visit products from the vet makes them worth a shot at least <br  >my dog has chronic ear infections  we are currently on a first name basis with the vet  as in  \\ hello  dwayne  i need the ear drops and ear cleansing solution for lorelei  yep  i will pick it up tomorrow \\  for the past 2 years we have used mometemax drops and the cleansing solution together and they usually clear the infection up within 7 10 days  while they work great  the cost for these two products is about  45  so when i saw these drops for  11 i thought they were worth a try  i also purchased a zymox cleansing solution product <br  >thankfully i checked the zymox website before i started the treatment  there were graphics all over the website stating that dogs  ears should not be cleaned while using the drops   thanks for not clarifying that  amazon  <br  >i had high hopes when i started using the drops  other reviewers mentioned that they have a bad odor but i did not think so  they were somewhat oily but not too bad <br  >i used the drops for 10 days and there was absolutely  positively no change whatsoever  my dog s ears were just as red and inflamed as day 1 <br  >evidently this is a miracle product for some dog owners  but it certainly was not for me  my advice is to try the drops if you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to vet products  but do not waste money on the ear cleansing solution as it is not even recommended to be used with the drops 
quality	my dog does not like bacon flavor or smoke flavor and she would not eat these treats not even to taste i gave them away  the texture was good   not too dry but if your dog does nto like smoke smell flavor this is not for you 
product	my dogs absolutely love this product  unfortunately the bag arrived half full of crumbs  the biscuits were dry and very crumbly  it obviously did not impact the taste  but i have had to scoop out their portions with a spoon into their dog bowls  for the price  disappointing  costco has something similar that i am trying next 
quality	would give a better rating if my betta would enjoy them    he ate them like crazy when i first fed them to him  but not anymore    he just turns away and lets these little worms just float on top of the water    so not sure what happened  but disappointed that my betta does not like them anymore   
product	very expensive for the size of the bag  my dog loved the treats but they hardened up really fast  would not buy again 
quality	i gave it to a 6 lb miniature poodle  she took and and then left it on the floor  did not eat it 
product	i opened the package to find the contents moldy   better quality control is needed  skip this expensive product and stick to dog bones 
health	i ordered several bags at christmas for three different adult dogs   two labrador retrievers and a golden retriever  the liver snaps were as hard as rocks  and none of the three dogs could chew them  in fact  i was so concerned that my own dog was going to break a tooth while trying  i took the treat away  and threw the rest of them out  the pieces are also small   about the size of a half dollar  given their near indestructible nature and jagged edges  if you have a dog that \\ gulps\\  its food treats  these could present a credible choking hazard  do not serve these to your dog  
product	have to coax my dog to eat them  also the tabs are small and if you have a large dog as i do  you have to get them to several tabs  not worth the effort  maybe ok for small dogs if you can get them to eat them 
product	very disappointed  i refereed others to this site  they were sent another bottle to make up for the size discrepancy but the product itself is not as effective as first defense  
quality	far too hard and not enough smell to atract my dog  he does not like it so i do not either and i will not order his product again 
quality	half of the sweet potato and carrot treats were black and moldy  called amazon   got return shipping labels and credits to my account  the oatmeal cranberry and apple treats were fine  but the dogs do not like them    go figure
quality	although my cat usually woofs down anything with tuna  she did not eat as much of this brand as i thought she would  she will leave a lot in the bowl and then follow e everywhere waiting for me to put something else down  i think i have fooled her because i mix this tuna with a can of another brand tuna and she will eat it all  i will not order this much again 
health	it seemed to work well  but i only used it for a short time  my dog started having digestive issues a couple weeks after i started using it  so i stopped  the digestive issues may or may not be related  there is not really a way to know  that said  i did notice a reduction in the amount of plaque on my dogs teeth in only a few weeks 
health	i bought 2 of these as i had a sick pet  they came out of the bag mushed or something like melted together  they were unusable 
quality	i have a newfoundland and i was not expecting these treats to be so tiny  he seems to prefer a chewy type of treat and really could not care less about these crunchy ones  i like to buy made in the usa  or anyplace other than china  really  for the stories i have read  and in that respect  these were good  i have also been going less grains  more other ingredients  however  sam s yams were a big hit with my boy  and i will go back to those 
product	my dogs love treats and will eat nearly anything  but they don  like these  i love wellness products  but they missed the target here  get wellness soft dog chews instead  they are more expensive but your dogs will love them 
product	the item is a small according to the title but the picture shows an x small  when i received it the package clearly states what breed of dog it is recommended for which is a good description for the size  i think it listed pugs   others that run in about the 20lb  size range  6mos adult is so misleading  i have a small 7lb  housedog   she just kinda looked at me like you must be kidding  she could not even carry it  learn my lesson  i will stick with the c e t  enzymatic chews  she loves those   they are good for her teeth 
product	my cats loved morning medley with trout  so figured they would love this  too  i have opened up 2 cans   neither of my 3 cats will even touch it  they smell it   walk away  so now i am stuck with 22 cans left out of the case  will not buy again 
product	i am a first time dog owner but have lots of friends and family with dogs  many of them have kong products and their dogs enjoy them greatly  i chose this one as something for my 4 year old austrailian shepard to play with while i am away  i purchased the one for her weight but it is huge   and hard plastic  i thought she would be able to chew on it but no way  i was really disappointed  it was really my fault for not reading more info on it  but i think it should be labeled for much bigger dogs  i will still try another kong toy but i want to see it before i buy it 
health	do not buy food from amazom  must have been sitting in a warehouse for years  made my cat very sick and cannot return  throwing it away 
quality	the texture is too hard and my dog turned his nose up at them  i ended up giving them to my friend for her dog  i would not purchase them again <br  ><br  >the size is good for training purposes 
quality	fancy feast fish and shrimp feast is not consistent in its flavor and contentsso sometimes it is the favorite and other times it is not eaten
health	it took me awhile to narrow it down  but i finally realized that these biscuits were giving my dog diarrhea  she does not have an overly sensitive stomach  so perhaps these are just too rich for her 
health	creates a choking hazard for the size dog we purchased the toy for    we will have to wait to use as a gift for a friend with a smaller dog
product	it was okay but i was a little disappointed in the size of the portions  we have ordered this brand before and the individual sticks were thicker 
health	my cats love this product however the chicken is hard and spikey  i am afraidf that they will choke  i have gotten 3 bags and only used half in each bag  the rest is wasted  i wish that something could be done  the last vendor sent me new bags that were fresh and did not charge me  other than that it is a very healthy snack for my cats 
health	my friend s dog loved it and i do not think she had any problems but my dog had diarrhea after i gave him 4 in one day  i bought the salmon flavor  it smells bad  to me  but the dogs seem to like how it smells 
product	our chihuahua loves these treats however  they are not made in the usa as one reviewer stated they are and that is reason why i bought these because i thought they were a usa product  i checked the company s website       and they say their treats are made in china but tested inspected in the usa  it is very difficult to find a small rawhide or wrap treat made in the usa apparently  also  the price of them i would say worth around  6 if they cost more do not get them  unfortunately  i paid  9 for mine  our dog does love them so we will continue with them but they are not really worth the hype 
health	cute treats  my dog loved sniffing the package but he would not eat the treats  the cat did  but they made her sick  such a disappoint
product	the chews arrived broken and i could not put them on her bone  that kind of spoiled the intention <br  >very disappointing
product	these are a disappointment  we were expecting chunks of treats not flakes  however  the cat does like them a lot 
product	the product is very good  but the packaging from the order i received in december 2012 is defective  when opened properly  the sealing mechanism is all on one side instead of secured on both sides  as a result  the package cannot be resealed after use  this makes it useless  since the product needs to be kept moist in order to wrap around the pills  i called american diabestes wholesale  the supplier  and the woman told me that her ocompany could not help me since it was a manufacturing defect  but that i should go to the amazon website with my complaint  i have bought this product from my veterinarian and from a pet store before and never had this problem 
product	would give this a 5 star rating  but it   like most pet food   is greatly overpriced for what you get 
quality	i have a tiny pom terrier mix dog and those biscuits were huge  i broke off a small piece but he was not interested  gave it to my daughter since she has a big  golden retriever  perfect snack for her dog but not mine 
health	santa brought this for two labs and a yorkie  the labs were great with it and i would rate it full stars for them  however  the yorkie saved his for later and then choked on his piece while eating it and was unable to pull it out of his mouth on his own  thankfully his human was nearby and  with difficulty  was able to pull it out  so i recommend it as a treat   but with careful supervision with a small dog 
product	the package had a good expiration date of june 2015  but when i opened the package the treats were moldy  i took photos   now  i know this is probably not a typical issue and my dogs love these treats     i think i am done buying these  unless at costco   no issues about the return  however  i just got an email stating the product is not available to ship  but when i goto the link they sent me  there are 17 in stock  so  i am questioning the reliability of the company  moldy treats  then they are either \\ misleading\\  me in my email or \\ misleading\\  the customers  i will be watching to make sure they refund my money 
product	my 2 yr old golden retriever loves them  however  30 lbs is a lot to keep on hand  so had to throw 1 2 the box out because they went bad  i guess i had them too long  they should make available in more places  could not find them in stores   ordered online in large quantity only  a 3   5 pound package would be better for me  put them in set stores   supermarkets 
quality	we have ordered these bully sticks several times  and while they have always had a  distinct  odor  this batch was beyond bad smelling  luckily  this seems to make the dogs love them even more  but we cannot stand to even be in the same room when the dogs are chewing on these   yuck 
product	this might work for a ball obsessed small dog  but my 60 lb 5 year old puppy really did not enjoy playing with it  it is also not the greatest quality plastic  i felt like it was going to break 
product	this is a healthy treat for your dogs but it is expensive for the amount of chicken that is in the bag  i will continue to buy my chicken treats from trader joes   
health	i have been buying these treats for my dog for some time but i am honestly getting sick of the price increases   how about 2 00 per container in the last year <br  ><br  >anyway  the treats are not filled with a lot of junk and the glucosamine is good for your dog s joints  i recommend this product but i do wish they would stop raising the prices continually <br  ><br  >update june 2013  these are now almost 15 00 a container   were 10 00 only a year or two ago  who are they kidding 
product	the pieces are so small they crush to dust easily  in addition the package had been compressed so it was mostly dust when it arrived  \\ whole life\\  makes a much better quality freeze dried chicken product  the pieces are nice and large  i stuff them into the ends of a kong bone for my big dog to play with  they wedge in there well enough to keep him happily occupied for an hour  if the pieces are too small they just fall out immediately  so \\ pure bites\\  does not work for this even without the dust 
product	my dog really liked it   but it was gone in 45 seconds he just crushed it and woofed it down
quality	my cat snowflake loves fancy feast but i should have paid closer attention to what choice i gave her for the morning serving  i do not think she liked eating dinner type food for breakfast  i did receive an insert on fancy feast morning s  may try this for a breakfast choice as it is a souffle with white meat   garden veggies and egg  i am not to sure because it may be the veggies she does not like because i do not normally give her food with the veggies in them 
product	do not buy this  it does not work  it does like your vet does  gives you a temporary solution to a permanent problem 
quality	this is supposed to be for baby rabbits but my baby did not want this  he wanted the adult version and turned his nose up at this  plus it is expensive  i just give him pretty much free choice of the adult version plus a little extra alfafa hay and veggies  he is growing nicely  i have bought two bags of this and both smelled off somehow  i will not buy it again 
product	what i thought was pink when i ordered it was actually tan brown color  i was a bit disappointed but i did not want to send it back because it wasnt worth the hassle  it works just fine   it does have a clip in the inside but my pooch still jumps out   
health	this is a total waste of money  my 4 8 lb  yorkie basically used it once and the thing fell apart from her trying to get the treats out  not only is it made poorly  it is really dangerous because she was able to chew right through the flaps in a minute and i had to pry the pieces of of her mouth  i cannot imagine what a big dog would do to this  
product	i bought these for training purposes but my dogs did not really care for them  the size is perfect but it was just like giving them a piece of regular dog food 
health	this bal container is good for putting other treats inside it but the ball refills are expensive and they make my dog sick  they also do not last for very long  putting the treat inside it is really difficult   very hard   takes a long time with lots of streength   and then once the dog has chewed enough to get it out she can eat the whole thing right away and then the next day has diarrhea all day 
health	gave my yellow lab diarrhea and bad gas  would recommend to look elsewhere for a good dry dog food  hard to find a good dog food for a sensitive stomach 
product	my two rotties love knuckle bones and the slices are the most economical to give them  however  they come paked two to a package  one of the bones in the package is useable but the other bone  seems to be an   34 end  34  and is not enjoyed  at all  by the dogs  so it goes to waste 
quality	we had bought this product locally for a lot of years  amazon s price was less so we bought from amazon  i checked the bag for dating and dumped it into the covered plastic container we have used to keep the food and began feeding to our cats  i noted that the cats immediately did not eat as much  not having some of the food i replaced i could not compare smell  etc  i am disappointed and will not be buying any more pet products from amazon 
product	not really sure why you would only need a 3 5 lb bag  really only lasted a few days  and the price is way higher than the stores  like the food a lot  sizing and pricing lacking 
product	must have been tasty though  because that is how long it took my lab to destroy this  i would not buy this again 
quality	while my 2 dogs love most of the three dog bakery products   they did not much care for the cranberry   yogurt bits  they both turned their noses up at the treats  so i cannot say i will be ordering this product again
product	i ordered nimble mega from ozbo in mid december  and the estimated delivery was one week later  my horse has been on nimble for a few years and it is a great product  but expensive  this looked like a good deal  so i decided to try it  however  three weeks after my order  they have still not even shipped the nimble  i contacted ozbo  and although their response was quick  they just said  they were looking into the delay  at first  and then that they were discontinuing the item and working with the supplier to get it sent to me  i canceled my order because i do not think it is acceptable that i did not hear about that for three weeks without asking  or that that is an acceptable reason for that long of a delay 
health	its okay  i was very disheartened when this arrived and it was very small  my lab looked at it and could put the whole thing in his mouth  so obviously he could not have it as i did not want him choking <br  ><br  >for the price i went to petsmart and bought the new all natural pork skin  chicken or vegetable covered hard bones  he loved them and they have no rawhide  <br  ><br  >if you want to read about them   <br  ><br  >dreambone dog chew        <br  >smartbones        
quality	my dog would not eat it  even my neighbor s dog who eats everything would not touch it  i would not even give it one star  but i could not review it without clicking one 
health	i ordered this item for my two chihuahuas who love duck jerky because i thought it was made in the usa  not china  with previous food products coming from china that have sickened and killed thousands of people and pets  i will not feed food to my dogs that have been made in china  this product was supposedly made in the usa  however  it is made in china  only   34 tested in the usa  34   i am pleased to say though that amazon gave me a full refund  what i would like to see  however  is amazon s description of their food products stating that the items are   34 made in china  34  or   34 made in the usa  34   gretchen b in san diego  california
product	my dog liked these treats  but then i figured out it was made in china  not worth the risk  so not buying again 
product	my 10 month old australian shepherd had this time torn up in about 5 minutes  the treat was out in 2 minutes and it took another additional 3 minutes for her to chew up and start eating the blue plastic ball so that another treat would not even stay in it  i trashed the whole thing first 15 minutes i had it  this might work for a really dumb dog but not one that has any brains what so ever  what a disappointment 
product	my dog loves these and i ordered on line because they are hard to find in the pet stores and rather expensive  but the smell is awful  it permeats the whole house  i had to pack them up and store them elsewhere as i use them up 
quality	i loved the smell and look of these   until after opening 4 5 cans i found it is all fish or chicken    we ended up feeding stray kitties with this one   for even the one that is not fussy  it is not worth to buy for her alone  we need a few different varieties  of flavors   so i went with merricks  and so far it is working out wonderfully   there is only one can that callie will not eat and that one we give to pasha  so have reordered this one 3 times now  
product	this cat food will keep you cat alive  they will probably ask for more    the food contains quite a few fillers and flavor enhancers that are cheap to use and leave the animal under nourished and over fed   cat food maker delight <br  ><br  >try a food containing almost all meat and meat by products with added vitamins  this is really all your cats need and will be better off in the long run <br  ><br  >feeding a more expensive higher quality food results in a happier healthier cat and cost little if any more  the animal will eat less of the quality food 
product	it would have been great if the correct item was in the box  it was supposed to be seafood variety but it was meat variety in the box  i wrote explaining the problem but it could not be resolved so i was given a refund  somehow they are packaged wrong  it says the right thing on the box but that is not what is inside  i received two boxes and they were both like this 
product	bag works well  it cinches shut and has a lining that is easy to clean  my only complaint is that the clip is plastic and does not really have any grip to it  it is not on a spring or clamp  it just basically clips on like a hook  basically  it will hook on to a belt or the waste of your pants  but if you happen to bend over or kneel down  which commonly happens while training a dog   it can easily come off your pants and fall to the ground  you would be better off using a carabiner and latching it to a belt loop or something    or finding a bag with a better clip 
quality	dog did not like the taste but he is very picky  ingredient list looks good and packaging looks good just cannot review higher since the pup will not eat 
product	i bought this a while back    shipping and packaging are all great  thanks amazon   but fancy feast just is not my cup of tea any more  i guess i should say my cats  cup of tea  <br  ><br  >the ingredients and nutritional value are severely lacking compared to other available cat foods  sure  you have to spend a bit more money to get a better cat food  but why would you want your cats eating leftover mcdonalds every day when they could be getting bobby flay and everything they need nutritionally for just 20 80 cents more a can <br  ><br  >don t skimp on your animals <br  ><br  >mine are both elderly at this point  once i learned all of the nutritional values and what your cats needs daily  etc  i switched to healthy foods to keep them running  jumping  kicking  and playing for as long as possible  i am not sure if i am allowed to brand drop here  but just do your research  go to a petsmart or something and look at the   34 natural  34  foods  cats are carnivores  also  they are not cows  stop feeding them grains   honestly  i am not this way with my own food  i will eat taco bell on the regular  then drop massive amounts of money on my pets  they do not live as long as us  keep them healthy and happy for as long as possible  the main way to do that is through their diet  
product	this stuff is not very highly rated on dogfoodadvisor com but my dogs seem to like it  i probably will not buy it again as my dogs like other food that is more highly rated 
quality	i bought these treats because i cannot find yummies around here any more  my dogs always loved these soft and chewy treats  unfortunately i did not give enough credence to the reviews  the package says soft an chewy but the truth was that my package contained rock hard treats  these are going back  come on amazon you can tell these are hard without opening the package why are you still sending them out 
health	my cat loves to chew  and i like to challenge and engage them with their play and eating  unfortunately  they barely lasted 24 hours  even though i threw them away over thanksgiving weekend  my cat just finished vomiting them 3 weeks later     i do not think it benefitted her gums at all   maybe this should be made in 2 plastic strengths  definitely supervise with this one  especially if you kitty loves to chew  my vet suggested using a small dog toy instead 
quality	if i remember correctly these were produced in the us for years  now i find they are manufactured in china  almost all of the pet toy and food recalls have been due to ingredients used in china so it is more than a major concern <br  ><br  >unlike the united states there are absolutely no quality control and safety regulations when it comes to products meant for pets  what is more   the manufacturer is new helcon which is the number one supplier of the most notorious and largest killer of dogs and cats the world has known via their products   the hartz mountain corporation <br  ><br  >rawhide in general is a slippery slope  certified organic rawhide is dried naturally and considered safe  however most rawhide is cured   and it is cured with a myriad of toxic chemicals including formaldehyde <br  ><br  >based on this information  and the current fda ban on chicken products from china  we will use our busy bones without the rawhide and be returning the two packages we bought <br  ><br  >pet toy manufacturers need to be more aware of how educated pet owners have become regarding the potential risk products from china pose to their beloved pets  no toy or treat is worth losing your dog over or even taking the chance <br  ><br  >there s no shortage of quality toys  treats and foods made here in the usa from locally sourced ingredients   these companies deserve our collective support 
product	after receiving this product i was rather concerned at the number of positive reviews from rabbit owners about this particular item  i would never feed this to my rabbits  or any other pet honestly  i was desperately trying to find a source for something to use to get one of my rabbits to take his medicine and decided to chance this since i could get it fast with amazon s overnight shipping  we usually use a different source for getting our papaya with no additives  which is much more rabbit friendly  and thankfully my order via them came faster than expected or we would be force feeding again <br  ><br  >i wish they had listed the ingredients on the product page for this product however  as these are not rabbit safe in the least for the cane sugar content alone  for future customers i am listing the ingredients as listed on the package here so that you may at least be better informed about the contents <br  ><br  >peter s nature treats  papaya    ingredients  papaya  cane sugar  citric acid  calcium chloride  artificial color fd c yellow  5    6  sulfur dioxide  preservative <br  ><br  >guaranteed analysis <br  >crude protein  min  0 0 <br  >crude fat  min  0 0 <br  >crude fiber  max  5 0 <br  >moisture  max  16 0 
quality	my picky 1 5 y o  girl did not care for those  she is a fan of freezer dried beef treats and milkbones and is not interested in any other treats  with the exception of a piece of cheese   chicken once in a while   i gave these cookies to a friend whose dog will eat anything  and it was sucess <br  ><br  >i personally believe that the quality of the treats is superior and dogs who eat everything and anything or those who are used to this kind of a cookie  will be happy with the biscuits 
product	my dog is not really big on this  the sound of the ball going down the house makes a little racket which scares my medium sized dog  also the suction on the bottom feet portion is pretty weak  so it is easy to knock over  after a while my dog would just stick her tongue into the food dispensing hole and eat the kibbles that way 
product	this is completely my fault for not realizing that i normally buy the 20 pound tidy cats at the store  the reason why i am giving the 1 star is due to the fact that you are being over charged for a smaller product  last time i went to the store  the 20 pound tidy cats was around  7  if you have multiple cats  like i do  this will not be enough to be delivered as a monthly subscription  save your money and just get it at the store  you will save yourself a lot of money in the end 
product	when my cat would use the litter box  the smell would fill the house  i did not even use all of it  i quickly switched as soon as i could buy something different  would never buy this again 
health	dog threw up each time she ate one before we had to throw out  not sure if it was just my dog but i would not recommend for every dog 
quality	my daughter recommended this   she uses it with her four cats  we have only three   but they would not go near the food with this on it  since our siamese only eat one brand and one flavor of cat food  i should have known  they would simply starve first  if i would not give in to their heartfelt cries   at full volume 
product	my dog does love these  and when i saw a 36oz canister  i was ok with overpaying just slightly to get the can to store future greenies in  however there is no canister  it is just 2 18oz packages in a paper box 
product	my jack russell requires a lot of stimulation through out the day  this meal time toy is a great substitute for regular bowl feedings  and is an additional way to keep skeeter happy and active <br  ><br  >one of the features i like is that as the food level becomes lower  the food comes out less frequently and is more challenging  this is a double edged sword because my pup will become frustrated after a certain point and start chewing to get to the remaining kibble <br  ><br  >my advice is this  when you hear that it is no longer rolling around  go and retrieve it  it will last a lot longer that way 
quality	is good  but my dogs do not care for it as much  they have to eat it any way it is good for them  great shipping and handling 
quality	thought being it was a   34 greenies  34  product the duck and pea flavor pill pocket would be a very good choice  much to my surprise not only did my dog hate it   she kept spitting it out  it had the most awful  horrible smell  no wonder she wanted nothing to do with it  i immediately threw out the rest  sorry  this product was a waste of my money 
product	the description says this is 1  so when i received a tiny little 2 oz package i was shocked  this is vastly overpriced at almost  12 for 6 tiny  pencil thin bully sticks  i complained to amazon about the wrong weight being in the description  but as of yet  they have not corrected it  dec 14  2012   description reads  \\  specifications  weight  1 lb  dimensions  9 5\\  h x 5\\  w x 1\\  d  6 pack  made in united states\\   further  if the description is wrong on the weight  how can i trust the made in us claim  this is an important fact for me as i avoid foreign products 
health	i am very disappointed with this treats   i have given this product before which i had brought from a bakery in california and it was fine  but these biscuits made both my dogs so sick   my corgi and my mini dachund both fell sick and my mini dachund   i hope you do something about thse biscuits which i paid a lot for and now stuck with them  
health	i have heard great things about this brand of dog toys  so i was super excited to get this for my siberian husky  i was very upset to find out once it arrived that it was super small  i could not give this item to my dog due to its size  she would have choked on it 
health	i need to find a new source of tendon chews for my 3 small dogs  30 lbs  and under   i purchased these a couple of times and only a few were really large  previous tendons i have purchased have been round  evidently these are flattened and they are hard as rocks  so there is a huge piece that i can seldom break into smaller pieces  so i get little value for my money  it seems it would not be that difficult for cadet to at least break these into 1 2  34  wide pieces instead of 1  34  plus  then it might be possible to break a 10 12  34  piece in half  my dogs are also having diarrhea this time and they never get diarrhea from tendons  i will not be ordering these again 
product	if it sounds too god to be true      <br  >while the add states you get a box of 12  you actually get only one <br  >supplier states it was an error in the listing  but went ahead and sent the single bag  the good news is a contact to the company netted a full refund and i got to keep the one bag 
product	my dogs seemed to like them   but there are only 6 chips in a bag  i paid almost  7 dollars and with 4 dogs they are not going to last long  just not worth it for me  i would recommend if the price want an issue   but i will not be buying them again 
product	ordered a 24 pack of this food  i feed the cats twice a day  morning and night  with wet food  usually by the time i go to feed them  they are right there waiting for it  i gave them this food  they smelled it for a second or two and both came back to me begging me for something else  that has never happened before with any other food i have tried with them  although it could be the texture of the food  they do like sliced and grilled fancy feast  maybe they are just not crazy about the classic style  whatever the reason  they did not like it   and only after they would realize that i am not giving them anything else  they would eat about half by the time it was next meal time  i started giving them other food in the morning and giving them this food at night until they finished the box  i will not buy them another pack of smooth pate type food  from any company  
product	i just received my pair today  they were much larger then what i was expecting  but that is not a bad thing at all  in fact i was happy to see the size of them  i have two cats and this size for them will last probably two weeks  they are also a good weight  which means my larger cat will not knock them over  and that is a plus since i have been dealing with my cat knocking over any type of containers i give her <br  >they do feel a bit cheap  not the best type of plastic  but its not bad  there could be much worse  it did come to me a bit dirty  probably just from packaging it  and the top is a bit lose on the food container  the cap on the water container also leaks  but once you flip it over and fill the bottom with water it is no longer a problem  if those two things was not broken i would give it a 5 star  other then that i love it so far  and so do my kittys <br  ><br  >we will see though  this is my first day using it 
product	i tried advantix ii because i was told i should switch flea and tick treatments out every 6 months or so  i had used frontline plus for years and never had a problem but thought switching things up made sense so tried advantix ii  big mistake   within a month of switching to avantix ii  fleas were all over our pets and house and what a very costly mess we had ridding ourselves of the bugs  i went back to frontline plus and all has been well since then 
quality	was not the chicken and rice that i ordered once before  the balls were bigger  very hard and darker in color   like they were made of other meat maybe beef or duck  it was not the chicken  they are light colored as shown in the picture <br  ><br  >my dog is tiny and could not eat them so i cut them up and still she was not happy with them  kind of ate some of it boooo   <br  ><br  >would like to order more of the original ones i purchased that were smaller but am afraid will get wrong ones again 
product	i may have done it wrong  but it did not seem to aid in the cleaning of my cat s ears  maybe i needed to massage it more  the instructions were not really there  so it is kind of a   34 figure it out  34  product  it was easier to apply than other ear cleansers though 
quality	dog does not like it  i do not blame her  smells like rancid oil  how long has it been on the shelves  
product	i have a spoiled rotten dog and am grabbing at straws when i look for treats that she will eat  i do not buy anything   34 made in china  34  for her health  but she sniffed these and walks away  even when hungry 
product	not really sure they repel fleas  my dogs still scratch and itch  probably will not buy again  not very good product 
product	the canned food itself is what the doctor ordered the 24 cans of cat food were not packaged as a case  they were lose and 12 that is half of the order  were dented when they arrived  i feel that i got the opened left over cans that fell out of other orders  they were also 7 different lots see below <br  >quanity<br  >1 best by date 6 15 13 lot   708 dented<br  >1 best by date 10 15 13 lot   710 dented<br  >1 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1546 ok<br  >1 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1548 dented<br  >2 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1548 ok<br  >1 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1550 dented<br  >1 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1557 dented<br  >7 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1549 dented<br  >9 best by date 10 15 13 lot   1549 ok<br  >24
health	bought these for my cat who has extreme food allergies and only eats duck and rabbit  greenies duck was discontinued and i searched alot for something else and found these  it says they are ok for dogs and cats  i was so happy to get the product but the cat will not touch these things  what a disappointment  they were quite expensive between the product and shipping but i guess kitty will not eat them  i suppose i should have tried to contact the manufacturer to get a sample before buying these 
health	my kitten is not very interested in these  the shape seems to appeal to her somewhat  as something to bat around  but she does not chew them  they are very  very thin and stick straight  unlike the image which looks thicker to me and irregular  they are so thin and straight that they look somewhat dangerous  like the cat could hurt herself if she got the end in her mouth just so  i will probably throw the rest out or give them to my daughter to see if her cat likes them  however  he is not the biter  my cat is  this did not help with my problem 
product	that is how long it took my 1 5yr old 65lb lab husky to polish this off  glad he enjoyed it  but really disappointed in how fast it disappeared  i bought three flavors in the \\ souper\\  size but no longer have great expectations 
product	my puppy loves to play with soda bottles   now with this product i can feed her from a big soda bottle  this treat dispenser was easy to put on the bottle and my puppy was not able to take it off <br  ><br  >update 12 27 2012  my puppy is not able to get the dispenser off but it is very heavy compared to the soda bottles and just does not work too well  i will continue to use it but not really happy with it 
health	i keep buying it but have nothing to compare it to  the bags fit in my cupboard and i am hoping it helps with hairballs  my 14 yr old cat loves it but throws it up 
product	all the petfood i have ordered online has come with some badly dented cans  that is a particular pain when the can is as small as a friskies can and the bottom is smashed in on one side as about 4 in this box were  another 6 or so had smaller dents  but on the product itself  our cat pretty much only wants to eat these  he would not fussy on the specific flavor as long as it is friskies  i have tried all sorts of more expensive and nutritionally better cat foods and he ignores them and howls until he escapes outside or gets friskies  same with dry food  he will ignore a bowl full of dry biscuits for days and redouble his escape attempts if i do not feed him the friskies  i am not sure if it is the cat equivalent of cocaine or junk food but our cat is addicted to them  he is healthy  his coat is good  he is the coolest cat we have ever owned  and he loves them  so they certainly work for him and  although i am pretty sure nutritionally there are better options  calvin remains a friskies cat to the very core  i better go  as his dealer i have to make sure the cupboard is stocked or things might get ugly 
health	i purchased this food for my kitties because the packaging touted a natural product that looked very healthy  my cats have thrown up everyday that they have eaten eaten it  i thought maybe it was just a coincidence  i switched them to a different brand and bought this again when i ran out of the other food  within two days of putting them back on this food they were throwing up again  if you love your animals then do not buy this product 
product	our dogs love these and the local stores were out  the box we received was nicely wrapped and undamaged  but every one of the treats inside was broken  many were crushed  the box full of cookie dust  they must have been seconds  or placed under something much heavier  very disappointing  i did not give them to our dogs 
health	i have a beautiful nordic variety golden retriever who has had continual problems with ear infections and irritations  i can no longer afford the vet s ridiculous charges  so i had to find something to care for her at home  after reading the reviews on this product  i purchased it with some positive expectations  unfortunately  it actually made the inflammation  at least around her outer ear  worse  i gave it a good chance  but she was uncomfortable and shaking her head more  i do not wish to bad mouth this product  due to the fact that this little darling dog of ours has had continual problems  she may be different than other goldies with unique problems  who knows  oddly enough  i have found that something as simple as unscented baby wipes  walmart brand  of course  has just about erradicated the problem altogether  once in the morning and once before her bedtime  and i have no more gross brown discharge or odor  her ears are just as pink as they out to be  imagine that  the very thing   34 they  34  tell you not to use works for my golden  this review is not intended to discourage others from trying this product  it may well work for your dog 
product	then this is for you  i accidentally got these instead of his buffalo jerky and the chow tried one crunch and looked at me in frustrated betrayal  he prefers a softer chew  and these things have the staying power of a souvenir from the petrified forest  we will donate them to the pound and hope they have a small army of wolves available to do them justice  on the other hand  if your dog has a bite powerful enough to take down your sofa  this treat promises a fair amount of chewing pleasure 
health	my neutered male cat phatboy cuddlecuss has been having problems with uti and crystal formation  the vet prescribed antibiotics and an urinary tract health diet  hence  i promptly ordered this food as purina has always been my brand of choice for my 5 indoor cats <br  ><br  >real chicken is the second ingredient in this food  with corn gluten meal being the first ingredient  i had intially thought of ordering the purina one uth diet but  went with this one as the real meat was the second  not the third ingredient as in the   asin b0000ah3r4 purina one special care urinary tract health formula cat food   formula  my cat will eat this dry food  but  he does not like it as much as my usual   asin b000wfktwm purina one cat indoor advantage cat food  16 pound   which has turkey as the number one ingredient <br  ><br  >he is slowly becoming more tolarant of this cat food  i have been adding the smallest bit of the purina one indoor to this to get him to eat more of it  i would order this dry food again  but  i will probably try the purina one uth to see if he likes it more 
health	the contents of this food is spoiled  that is the best i could make out from what the store bought version looked like and the amazon bought version <br  >there was a visable difference  the store bought version had real chunks of tuna  the meat was white  the smell was good  my cat loved it  so i bought a whole box full of it from amazon  it was different  it has this retched smell  and it was darker in color  there were no visable chunks of tuna  and the meat looked rotten or spoiled <br  ><br  >i m really mad right now  i have no money to purchase other food brands for my cat and am worried sick as my cat will not eat the contents of this can  my cat is starving instead of eating this <br  ><br  >if you are going to buy this  do not buy the amazon brand  they are stocking spoiled version  your cat will not eat it 
quality	our dog does not like it at all  had to buy some sprinkles  beef liver  here at amazon to make our 8 month old  18 lbs terrier mix to like it  and even then it takes her a long time to finish a cup of it on a twice a day feeding  she does get a few treats in between so that could be messing it up  our vet recommends it so have to view it like vegetables to a child  it is good for her even if her tongue and taste buds disagree  update  01 15 2013       only rates science diet puppy as 2 5 stars  we mixed it with eagle pack dog food puppy which is rated 4 stars in same website and our dog loves the combination  50 50   she eats it fast and we do not even have to put the beef liver sprinkles anymore 
quality	my 3 dogs usually like dogswell jerky  but for some reason  they did not like  vitality   i do not know if it is the taste or smell or what the problem is  but they will not eat it  this is the first time they have turned down a  treat  
health	i had been buying the 3 lb  size of theses mini biscuits  and decided to try this 20 lb  box to save some money  however  while these are advertised as   34 mini  34  they are twice the size of the mini biscuits that come in the 3 lb  bag  which necessitated me having to try to break them in two for my small dog  they are hard as a rock  so no easy task  my dogs were also getting diarrhea after i switched  and i notice that the 3rd most prominent ingredient is wheat bran  not sure of the wheat bran content in the 3 lb  size  so based upon these factors  i am disappointed and will not purchase again 
product	we own 7 different treat toys  used for feedings to slow the eating process  our food is medium size dry food from acana champion  wildprairie   no use feeding any treat or food with this ball  there is a lip on the inside of the exit hole wich blocks the food from  sliding  out of the hole  just a big teaser  and frustrating for very intelligent dogs and owners as well  i cannot even shack the food out when i try  the issue is not with the adjustable disc in the center  you can leave it out and have the same problems 
health	my guinea pig really does not like this stuff  and he will not eat it as much as the regular  plain pellets that i bought for him in the past  i have heard comments before that kaytee is not that good of a brand  but i was desperate when i bought this because i could not get to a store to buy his usual brand  plus  after i started feeding this to my guinea pig  he got sick  i am not sure if this was the cause  but when i stopped and started feeding him something else he recovered very quickly  felt like a waste of money  i will not be buying this again <br  ><br  >it made him poop a lot more than normal though  which is not exactly a plus 
product	we were having troubles  for really the first time in 4 years  with our 5 pound maltipoo  she used to love these braided chews  and when we started buying them we thought they were made in the usa  the last bag we bought said \\ made in china\\  now  new style bag   we stopped giving her the treats  and the itching no longer needs medication to keep her from scratching  and she does not seem to be convulsive either <br  ><br  >would not recommend these for any size dog 
health	i have been buying this wheat free healthy dog treat since it was first made by a small husband and wife company and called barkwheats  the couple sold their product to clear conscience pet and the name of the treat was changed  as well as the price increased  a representative of clear conscience told me the amount in the bag increased  but i do not think one ounce warrants such a large price increase  i have no choice but to keep buying the product because it is the only safe treat for my dog  but i do resent the price hike <br  ><br  >update 12 2013  i continued to buy this product from amazon to avoid shipping charges  even though i felt that the price increase was unjustified  since it is the only commercially processed treat my dog can safely have  clear conscience pet had me over the proverbial barrel  no longer  i have bought my last high priced batch since i have learned to make homemade dog biscuits using all the ingredients listed in ginger yaps except canola oil  it is really easy to make them at home  wish i would tried it long before now   you have to scroll all the way down the screen on the amazon product description page to find the list of ingredients  and they are not all listed on the clear conscience pet website  just the \\ good\\  ones  so it is easy to overlook  because of the canola oil  i am changing my rating for this product <br  ><br  >most people do not realize that canola oil  while cheap  which is why food processors use it   is not a healthy fat  it is processed with chemicals  heated to a point that destroys anything beneficial about it and deodorized to make it taste and smell fresher than it actually is because it tends to go rancid very quickly  rancidity means the oil is oxidized  which can cause arthritis and other health problems  including cognitive ones  so   cruncherz lost my confidence when i finally noticed that one of its ingredients is bad for dogs  and humans   if you doubt this  just google \\ why is canola oil bad\\  or \\ why is canola oil unhealthy \\ unhealthy \\ 
product	stopped using this product as soon as i realized it was made in china  cannot take a chance since soooo many dogs are dying from food coming from china 
product	this has to be the worst chicken snack i have ever purchased  very disappointed  my buddy loves chicken snacks and he hated<br  >this product  this thing was super dry and smell like it was in the warehouse for decades  avoid it 
product	i will not buy these again  they seem to be expensive for what you get and my dog will eat them if no other treats are offerred 
product	my vet suggested we get the wobbler to help keep our very active and problem 7 month old burmese cat occupied  priced in australian stores at almost double amazon s price including postage i bought through amazon  longest delay was with australian customs the kong is well made and sturdy but in spite of trying all the suggested ways to get him to use the kong  he cannot seem to get the hang of it  he is quite happy to use the bottom bit as feeding bowl as suggested but once the top goes back on  he prefers to go hungry for the whole day  as he has had no trouble learning other toys and tricks  i am disappointed this has been failure  however vet s 3 legged surgery moggy loves his so it is not really the kong but perhaps a warning should be made that not all cats will master it 
product	in the past  i have only fed premium food to my cats and dogs  however  food choices for senior cats are hard to find at the major retailers  i was glad to find this source  even if it is friskies  at least i can believe it is properly formulated for senior cats  while my cat is not crazy about the flavor  i do not think i have ever found anything short of cooked  unseasoned meat that she really does like a lot  after the can is opened and the first meal served  it is back to being finicky with the rest of the can  no matter how expensive or elaborate it might be 
health	my dog suffers from chronic ear infections  and i am always on the lookout for a homeopathic remedy that might help  unfortunately  this one didn t  after applying it for 10 days  her ears were worse than ever  and i had to make a trip to the vet for antibiotics 
product	i purchased one of these 4 years ago for my dog  it was great  i loved it  she loved it  it started to break after those 4 years which i thought was a great lenght of time for a dog toy  when i got another puppy  i purchased another so they would each have one  they love to play tug of war  the 1st one finally wore out  after 4 years  the second one broke after less than 2 months  i figured  oh just a freak thing  purchased another and that one never even lasted the afternoon with this puppy  very disappointed in it 
quality	we have 2 guinea pigs  but they do not eat this food  since they would tip the bowl over  we could never tell how much they were eating  unexpectedly  we found one dead  following this  we finally got a bowl that attaches to the cage and tip proof  we discovered that the 2nd guinea pig is not touching the food either  i suspect the other one starved  no other explanation  i would not buy this food 
health	dogs got diarrhea everytime i gave them one of these  threw them out  will not try them again  sorry for the dogs 
health	when these hooves arrived they looked good   clean  made in usa according to label  good size  etc <br  ><br  >however  my dog is able to splinter these hooves into small pieces immediately  the pieces range from 1 4\\  1\\  and there is no piece large enough to salvage  if i were to let him  he swallows the pieces after barely chewing them  and i cannot imagine that that is safe from a digestive   choking standpoint  i would definitely not give these to a dog unsupervised  which for me is the whole point of buying them   to reduce boredom when i am not home   so i am returning them 
product	this item is a rip off  all three bags at the price of  62 00 are more powder than pieces that can be utilized  an absolute rip off 
quality	my two pit bulls do not even play with the kong wobbler  they like the other kong toys but for some reason  they do not like this one  even if i put their favorite treats in it  they still do not play with it  do not waist your money 
product	hi  while i am always looking for cheaper ways to treat my animals  i have tried this product and find it effective  just like capstar  my only gripe is that it does not work for very long  but neither does capstar  now that we have used two packages of this product i can say with assurance that this product works for approximately one week  and no more  i will continue to try the  little city  products  as they are much less expensive than the brand name  but for just a little bit more money i am going to try the  program  look alike product  since it is supposed to work for a month  my critters and i live in the valley in california and fleas are just awful  i hate seeing my animals struggle with them  itching  scratching the fur right off their bodies during the summer  poor babies  i cannot afford to take them all to the vets for flea care  i have many critters  so this is the next best way to deal with the problem  anyway  my only problem with this product is the short duration of effectiveness  i recommend the longer lasting little city product that is like program 
product	i have bought these before at the petstores and thought this one would be like those but was disappointed to discover it is much smaller than the ones i buy at petsmart and other local stores  the gerbils love the product  but i would recommend picking it up locally if you can 
quality	just like the seafood salad flavor  these are rejected by all 3 of my cats  they like deep sea tuna  also pet greens  but the consistency of these is not good and they must smell awful because the cats will not touch them  i saw them eat one once  then left all the rest until i removed them from their dish 
product	i purchased several kinds of these treats from the same company in hopes that the dogs would like at least one  unfortunately  they did not like any of them  and i wound up tossing out  35 worth of treats  as all dogs have their own favorite foods  i cannot really blame the zuke products  but  it would really be better if they offered a \\ sampler\\  of their products in very small amounts so that you could test them on your dogs without spending a lot of money  and then possibly tossing it all out 
product	these were one of our go to treats for the pup  the recent bag i received has a different look  both the package and the product  the ingredients list has changed and the treats are now a crumbly moist texture  not thrilled  was zukes sold to one of the big treat manufacturers 
health	i ordered this puzzle for my american eskimo  he quickly figured out all he has to do is turn the whole thing upside down to get all the treats  this toy is not ideal for a dog that is good at puzzles <br  ><br  >i was also very disappointed by the quality of the puzzle  the plastic is very cheap and very thin  if your dog is a chewer at all  they will easily destroy that plastic  we do not have that problem with our dog  but i sincerely feel like a bored puppy or dog could turn that plastic puzzle into a choking hazard within a short amount of time 
product	i guess it is my fault for not understanding the amount in ounces  but i expected a larger package of treats  this one was enough for about a week 
quality	i was not happy with this product it did not fresh at all i usually get this from a pet store but it is not always easy to get there  so i ordered it on line and was dissapointed not fresh
quality	my dog would not eat these treats  granted  he is somewhat picky but still thought i would share that information  they did arrive on time and all though  not the seller s fault that my dog was not interested 
product	this treats may seem like a great option for you furry friend  and we thought so too  our corgi mix really was enjoying them  but every time he would have one of the treats he seemed to get an upset stomach  i quickly realized that these treats are made in china  please think twice before purchasing these for your dog 
product	our pekingese pug mix came to us with pretty bad dental issues  we purchased the greenies because of the excellent reviews  our dog loved the taste of the greenies and it seemed to neutralize his bad breath for a little while  but i did not notice any improvement over the time that we were feeding them to him  as a side note  these are a great size for a 20 lb  dog 
product	my poodle did not like them  she prefers the ones we buy locally at the pet store  the problem is they sell out sometimes  these were mostly dark and she likes the lighter ones of the bunch  i will not buy these again 
quality	the treat portions of this product are fine  the ball itself  however is not  upon opening the item  the noxious smell was overwhelming and the texture was slimy  as i did not want my entire house to smell like a petrochemical  i wrapped the ball in a plastic grocery sack  hoping the smell would dissipate  this would also allow time for the replacement treats to arrive as the ball only comes with one of the two sides filled with a treat  and placed it in a cupboard  even wrapped in the bag and in the cupboard the smell still permeated throughout my kitchen  so i wrapped a second bag around the offensive thing <br  ><br  >after two weeks the smell had not dissipated in the least  however  i placed another treat in the empty side and offered it to my 70 pound english bulldog  she sniffed it and looked at me like i was insane  between my husband and i we managed to remove the treats from this stinky  slimy mess  and i wrapped it in two plastic bags and threw it in the garbage <br  ><br  >my dog was happy enough with the treats by themselves  but the ball was useless  what a waste of money 
quality	unfortunately i threw away the brand of the last bag of bully sticks i bought at an awesome price  i am trying to look in my order history to try and track the brand down  my dog would chew those sticks for hours and it would last a couple of days  he is an older rescue  and an ex rock chewer so his teeth are not as sharp as other dogs <br  ><br  >these do smell but you cannot have it all  i was shocked when my dog finished it in under five minutes  upon closer inspection of the sticks it seems that they are hollow seem to be filled with something while other sticks he has chewed in the past are a complete hard chew in all layers  they do vary in size shape and i am guessing they are sold like that since it is labeled as a 1 pound bag <br  ><br  >if you are looking for a brand with consistent high quality  i read the good reviews  then i suggest you look elsewhere 
product	very disappointed that this product is made in china  i will not be purchasing product again  they hide this information in tiny print 
health	original review   5 stars  \\ my cats like the flavor\\    i use this mainly as a flavor enhancer on cat food for my elderly cat whose appetite sometimes needs a little encouragement  i like it better than fortiflora s premeasured packets for this purpose because i can easily use the amount i want with the included tiny scoop  psc pets sent me a generous free sample of another product to try along with my first order  i just placed my second order <br  ><br  >update 14 august 2013  downgrading my review from 5 stars to one star  read on to see why so harsh <br  ><br  >last batch i purchased  in april 2013  was of very poor quality  but this is not the sole reason for the downgrade   it smelled rancid  and the cats would not eat it  customer service immediately replaced it with another bottle  but that one was bad  also  so i returned them both and received a refund for my original purchase  initially i was impressed with the responsiveness of psc pets  customer care  i was told the problem had been investigated  an anomaly identified  and a solution was in progress  i was offered a free unit to be sent once the new product had been manufactured so i would not have to keep trying the product to find out if it was okay again  this was projected to happen in a few weeks  time  because i was so impressed with the effort they were making to correct the problem and restore my confidence in their product  i elected to hold off updating my review with my experience of bad product  and i told them this  for which they thanked me <br  ><br  >sadly  i did not hear back from the company for a couple of months until i contacted them again  evidently  the customer service rep who had been handling my case with great skill had left the company  her replacement had little interest in fulfilling the commitment the previous rep had made  at first she asked for more information about the situation  but my last two inquiries  including a cc  to the company ceo as to the status  went unanswered  i did advise that my previous good review remaining good depended on how psc pets ultimately responded to this problem  because i wanted to be able to compliment them  and to continue to buy the excellent product i would formerly known  and that my cats went nuts over <br  ><br  >since psc pets never supplied me with a corrected sample as promised  i cannot verify that the product is good again  and their failure to follow through with their modest  but appropriate and welcome concession  has been another disappointment <br  ><br  >so  one star for bad product  based on the last two units i received  and i am not willing to pay again to find out if they have fixed it yet  combined with total failure in a customer service scenario that had so much potential to be a positive for the company  i now regret withholding negative information about this product from my fellow amazonians for so long <br  ><br  >update 14 november 2013  never did hear back from customer service or the ceo  since then  i have found a more cost effective solution for spiking the flavor of my inappetant cat s food  a soft pounce treat crumbled on top  there are probably 200 of them in the bottle that only costs  1 
product	i bought this flavor edible nylabone for my \\ industrial strength\\  chewing dog who is just over 1 year old  although he enjoys all of the nylabone flavors  he goes through them in record time because he is a chronic chewer  considering how much it costs i decided it was not worth it  instead  i now buy purina chewnola bones   they entertain my little guy for hours and he keeps going back to it until it is gone  i recommend this to anyone with a dog who is into chewing  i also recommend you buy them on amazon since you can pay as much as 50  less than you pay at a store   the 3 stars is because the cost does not match the lasting power  
health	in the past  i have never had any problems getting the correct order  however  i ordered 2 cases of fancy feast elegant medleys tender turkey primavera  instead  i received 8 boxes of the primavera medleys  this contains three different kinds of cat food one of which is fish  i have a cat that is prone to bladder infections anytime she eats fish  normally  i would return an order that was not correct  however  my cat is hungry and would like to eat   so i have 12 cans of wasted cat food  when i reviewed my order  i discovered that this company was under review for problems with orders  thanks  amazon  i would have liked to have known that before i ordered this product from you again           
health	my two chihuahuas loved \\ cadet gourmet pet treats duck breast fillets\\   the 32 ounce package i had been buying at costco  however  i discovered it was made in china and feared this product could make them sick or cause death  so i started searching for a company in the usa that made dog jerky treats  i found plato natural duck strips and ordered a bag  this product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips  my chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away  it does not even smell like duck  rather  it smells somewhat fishy  a waste of my money 
product	was not sure if she would like it  since she is not really a chewer   but we need something for her bad gums teeth  shes on a diet so shes pretty hungry so she did fit with it to get a treat  mission accomplished 
product	do not feed this to your dog unless you do not care that the ingredients include by products  who knows where they came from  if you value your dog s health never buy food that contains by products 
product	something seem wrong when all bags of product are broken in to pieces  do not buy this product  to return open bags is more hassle than worth  just do not buy from amazon 
health	hate it       <br  ><br  >food contaminated      nest of worms    please do not buy it     you would harm your dog    <br  >i expend   450 00 dollars in vet services    between mi two dogs<br  ><br  >be very carefull in what you buy for your dogs
quality	i do not know what it is  but my cat does not like the paté  he licks the juices from the paste and just leaves it there  i have heard this from multiple cat owners  i love fancy feast  but this is one that i am going to stay away from  i will be more cautious so i do not buy paté again 
product	i do not know personally how effective this product is  i give it to my dog  the vet says it is a great product  and i suppose it does what it is supposed to do <br  ><br  >my gripe is the packaging  the last box arrived completely crushed  the flaps on the box where outside the box  since the contents consist of 30 sachets of powdered nutritional supplements  the contents were not damaged per se  but the box was crushed  a little more pressure and i am sure the paper sachets would have ripped 
health	my dogs loved these  however  i started to notice a correlation between providing these to my dogs and digestive flare ups in one of my dogs whose system is more delicate  she was having experiences bordering on diarrhea several times a month  once i stopped giving her these treats  the problem went away  so  i would advise others not to purchase them 
quality	i bought this treat for my dog  it seemed very healthy and thought she would like them  however  when i first gave them to her  she smelled it and walked away  i tried giving it to her several times  mixed it in w  her other treats  however  she always stayed away from this treat  she did try it once but spit it out  oh well     i cannot really give this product a negative review but  my dog did not like the flavor of it so  i donated the bag to my local animal shelter instead  at least they can get some use out of it if the dogs will eat it 
product	do not buy from amazon  they will ship you a container that has been expired for 3 years  i did not realized they were expired until 1 week after i received it  under the can is a stamp that says exp 15 sep 2009 
product	bought the jumbo greenies for my black lab  he loved them  but at  2 66 each they are way too expensive for regular use  did not notice any difference in breath which was the primary reason for buying 
health	when i received my last order both cases were full of bent cans  while i would never have purchased a bent can at<br  >pet food or grocery store  i decided not to return the order as it is so much trouble  since i had a good stock of food for my cats  i put the cases in cabinet unopened  my six cats all eat rx science diet as their basic diet i use two cans of this daily split amoung them for treat  two days after arrival of product i note a disgusting smell<br  >coming from kitchen area  two cans were so badly damaged they were open  i threw the rest away  i have a total of eight rescued animals  all cats are alley cats and the dogs are mutts  they are gold to me  the cats are well cared for indoor pets  obviously  i clean constantly and support the clorine and disinfectant industry  this was a disgusting experience for me  i am canceling my monthly order now    asin b002cjaoiu friskies cat food classic pate  special diet ocean whitefish dinner  5 5 ounce cans  pack of 24   
quality	victor loves toys  is a big chewer  and i would heard a lot about the awesomeness of the raspberry toy in this line  so i got him this eggplant  he is not very interested in this toy  it is durable and smells minty nice  but he loses interest really quickly  the treat opening is too big   i would need a ton of peanut butter to stuff it  i like that it has an unpredictable bounce  but dog is underwhelmed 
product	this product did not work as well as the same one i always purchase from my cats veterinarian  it worked a little  then he still scratched liked crazy  must be old or very weak  will never buy again 
health	i just received a notice from zupreem pertaining to a recall for the food i purchased please check at       for information pertaining to this recall the food has high levels of calcium and could harm the bird making them sick or even fatal  i need information on how to obtain a refund 
quality	my cat will not eat anything with fish in it which is why i purchased this variety pack that showed the variety as being chicken  beef and turkey     it came with four salmon which i could not use     also  it was delivered through usps that would not leave it at the door because i had to sign for it and i was at a doctor s appointment     so days later i had to find a way to the post office to sign for it and pick it up which i would not have complained quite as much about ordinarily  but i have severe arthritis in my knees which is why i had cat food delivered to my door in the first place 
product	i have used this product many times over the last year  it is adequate but not the miracle cure so many claims are made about it  it is primarily vitamins and very little protein <br  ><br  >i was very unhappy with the delivery time of this purchase and would not re order <br  ><br  >first time disappointed with an amazon vendor
product	this product did not kill the fleas on my pet  i even applied it again about a week later  and still no results  very disappointing 
product	we used the wash first and some fleas were found  but the fleas were not reduced at all  their coats were shiny and they smelled nice  but that is about all that happened  was enamored with the other reviews and was sadly disappointed  still looking for a safe solution to the problem 
health	it is been two weeks and my poor kittens are still infested with fleas  apparently this product is not the one for us  i am getting a better result when giving them a bath  off to the vet we go 
product	i have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew  50  pomeranian  50  australian shepard   i sure caught the name \\ everlasting\\  in this product  i got her one and gave it to her the other day  she ripped it open and ate the treat  which is big  in 12 min  and then started to rip the rubber plastic  this thing is garbage  any dog will rip right through it  not only is it not \\ everlasting\\   it was about the worst lasting chew she has ever had  my advice is do not buy this product  your dog will eat right through it and end up ingesting plastic 
product	this arrived with 11 of the 24 cans dented  must have been the manufacturer because it was adequately packaged for shipping and no dents tears in outer box holding cans   one can even opened up and coated the other cans  what a mess   
health	like many similiar foods  poor quality ingredients  i only bought it as emergency food for when my cat refuses all wet food  at least i know the levels of phosphorous etc are safe for him 
quality	be advised  20 bully sticks for  35 is a good deal  but these are not low odor  they smell absolutely atrocious  another review said the same thing but i figured i would give them a chance anyway <br  >the first warning sign was when my mailman delivered them and asked what was in the package because they made his whole truck smell  i opened them once inside and gagged    i honestly do not know how they get away with calling them low odor  if i were to be asked i would say they were extra stinky    they really were terrible <br  >my wife said to leave them outside to air out so ill let you all know if that helps  but i have smelled rancid  putrid meat that smelled better  if overnight airing does not help at all i will be returning them <br  >not reccomended unless you have no sense of smell 
quality	this is expensive  but it does not stink as others have stated  my dog loves these sticks  and it actually takes him a while to get through a stick  i gave him one yesterday and he chewed off a side and has hidden the rest of the stick somewhere in the house  luckily  the thing does not smell and hopefully will not attract any bugs now that it is no longer summer 
product	the sweet potato and duck wrap has been specifically named in the latest fda report as one of the dog treats that is unsafe to give your dog  please read the latest report yourself  i also recommend a facebook page \\ animal parents against pet treats and food made in china\\  that list the facts on the brands that are considered to be unsafe  the cadet brand is named in the complaint  i have always bought my pet treats from the rawhide depot vendor on amazon  and have ordered the cadet brands   unaware that most cadet dog treats were sourced from china  i will continue to order from rawhide depot  i have gotten excellent service with them  however  i will not order the cadet brand of dog treats again 
health	i commented on someones review of this product whos dog became very ill  which caused me to look at some of the other negitive reviews and i would like to offer information about this product and my experiance with smokehouse  i have purchased this brand for many years  i have also purchased other brands  none of my dogs has every gotten sick from a smokehouse bone  at one point i purchased a bag of 3 bones that were a differant brand  when i opened up the bag a cloud of mold poofed into the air  obviously i did not give them to my dogs  my point is this the brand this happened with is well known and reliable  but that does not mean nothing ever goes wrong  most people at sometime in their life have purchased a moldy loaf of bread  or cheese or even gone to a resturant where there was something very definantly wrong with the food  it may not happen often but when it does its dangerous  and unpleasant  but we still continue to buy food at the grocery store and go to resturants <br  ><br  >there are differances in opinions of even vets as to whether or not you should use properly cured beef bones or raw hide chews  i have never had a problem with the cured beef bones from smokehouse and i know of vets that recommend bones vs rawhide chews and rawhide chews vs cured beef bones  yes pieces of bone can be broken off  swallowed  and then get lodged in the system  i also know of dogs that have had rawhide chews that have caused serious health issues  if a dog gets a large enough piece of rawhide swallowed  contrary to what some think it does not get fully digested and can also cause vomiting and even a blockage <br  ><br  >when you deal with food whether its for pets or humans things do go wrong <br  ><br  >the smokehouse bones keep my dogs teeth free of tartar  they have fun  i am happy and have never had a problem  i under no circumstances will give my dogs rawhide anything  i have know of several dogs that have had issues with rawhide and only one dog that had a minor problemwith a cured beef bone and it was not a smokehouse bone <br  ><br  >update important<br  ><br  >after years of giving these bones to my dogs and i have been perfectly happy with them i now sadly have to change my recommendation  the last 2 bones i received caused me to understand the negitive reviews others have given because their dogs have gotten very ill  i believe i know what caused it  generally these bones come with some meat and fat on them but it has been smoked to the point where it is crispy  as a long time dog owner i should have known better what was going to happen  the last 2 bones we got there were large amounts of fat that were still greasy and malable  my poor dogs had diarea for several days  the fat was just too rich for their stomachs  i am ashamed that i did not think it through before i gave my dogs these bones  they were absolutely miserable and it was my fault <br  ><br  >if you choose to get these bones you must be careful  if the meat and fat is not crispy please do not give them to your pets  because most likely they will get very sick  i cannot believe i was so stupid and i feel horrible that i misdirected others that there were no issues with these bones and i apoligize to all of you and your pets  it brought tears to my eyes when i saw how miserable they were  i want to say i am sorry to them and to everyone whos animal may have gotten sick because of what i said 
product	ordered this because it pictured the older packaging  stating  pacific salmon   it was not the older package that got delivered but the new one  its not the same flavor   very misleading and would not have ordered it if i had known  i can go to petco and get the old packaging for a bit more money 
product	my dogs loved it  but it only lasted a day  my small  45lb  golden retriever ripped one of the legs off the first day  its still a great toy though  the dogs love it and it does not damage the wood floor or furniture 
health	i have been using this dog food for quite some time  until my dog started throwing up and basically would not eat much of this dog food anymore like he used to  i stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic  my dog started eating again and stopped throwing up  i will not be buying this dog food anymore 
health	many of the bones are covered with some kind of mold  i did not discover it until i opened two of them for my two labs  without looking too closely i offered them  but only one bone was taken  i then looked at the other and found the mold on both ends of the filled bone  i have asked amazon com to issue me a return authorization  i have used this product before  and i am shocked at the lack of quality control  i hope i did not harm my dogs   
product	we have ordered this item via subscribe and save for a couple of months and it has always arrived damaged  usually one or two cans are opened  nothing more to report   this month the package contained a number of open cans that contained families of maggots that paraded across our bathroom floor  not the bonus you are hoping to get with your online cat food order 
health	don  t buy it  my dog loves the treat  however  after i found out it was made in china  i decide to throw away the remaining portion  i do not want to take any chances  i see that someone left a review saying their dog got sick after eating the treat  luckily my dog is doing fine still  but i will not buy this again 
product	my dog hates this food  and through some research i have found that science diet is not very good quality  i have instead switched over to orijen  a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog 
quality	my cat is a doll faced persian  he wil eat just about any cat food  he absolutely loves the purina healthy life dry cat food  so i was really pleased to see a  healthier  purina cat food  and decided to try it  he absolutely refused to eat it  so i tried mixing it with the healthy life cat food  and he actually picked the healthy life out of the bowl piece by piece and left the rest  it was a total waste of money 
product	the hole is huge   food falls out so easily not a good work out toy at all  way too much for shipping my fault i did not notice and they did not ship it until a week after i ordered it  not worth it <br  >also chihuahua ate through toy  not the most durable 
product	idiots ship this box inside of an envelope    this makes the box crushed and items leaking    yeah it is cheaper than 1800petmeds  but i would rather have a product that works 
health	this product is completely useless  my dog was infested with ticks just days after applying advantix ii  i called the customer service number to find out what products are safe to use with advantix ii and was told that they had not done any testing with other products and that they recommended not using anything with advantix ii because they cannot guarantee that it will not overdose your dog  okay   what should i do  i got lots of sympathetic clucking from the customer service rep  but no answers 
quality	my cat usually cannot get enough of his daily wet food  but he will not eat this stuff  he completely licks all the sauce off and leaves the entire bulk of the food  every  damn  time  he is not picky with any other wet canned food  only this 
product	we were having a hard time finding turkey dog treats in our local pet stores so i turned to the web  although these treats were much more expensive than this we usually buy  i bit the turkey and ordered them as they are our little dogs favorite  sad to say  these are really like rawhide  not like jerky  they are much harder to chew and she cannot even bite through them  considering the price paid plus shipping  we are not at all satisfied 
quality	these treats were my dogs favorite but the company has changed the formula now  instead of duck wrap we have duck paint with some bits floating about  a rip off and misleading  my dog rejected this product and will not go near the treat 
quality	keeping in mind that dogs  like humans are unique  my molly  who has ibs and is  admittedly  a very picky eater took one sniff of en and walked away  she refused to even try it  additionally  she refused the en dry food  i have had much better luck w  wildness salmon  natural choice turkey and purina one canned food as well as science diet i d dry food 
product	pellets do not dry    ever  pads soaked after 2 uses  urine overflowed onto floor  this system is a mess  a real waste of money  especially for someone on social security  update  because i missed return date due to hurricane isaac evacuation  amazon refunded the litter box purchase price and gave me contact info to contact the company that sent the pellets  thank you amazon 
product	this product did not seem to help my plants at all  it also discolored and clouded up my aquarium water  which was very disappointing 
health	i ordered this product because my puppy had a similar treat before and really liked it  i ordered these and gave him one treat  his stomach got really upset and he threw up and had bad potties  if your puppy has a sensitive stomach i might try something different 
health	i have a cat with a very sensitive stomach and i thought i had ordered the cat food that made her stomach purr   for some reason this cat food gives my adorable cat the runs  i should have ordered the classic fancy feast  so i have to give away three cases of cat food since my cat makes it very unpleasant for all of us when she \\ runs\\   i was going to order the classic but it was through another vendor and i would have had to pay shipping  grilled fancy feast was ordered but i actually did not come out ahead with having the cat food delivered to my door with no shipping costs  i will donate it to a shelter and go back to finding the classic fancy feast at the grocery store  i am working with the vet to find a diet that agrees with her and one she will eat  classic was finally one that i found that worked  i would like to say that amazon rocks  it is so convenient to order things on line and have them there when you need them   of course that is only if i am not paying shipping   
product	don  t buy if your pet likes vet nutri cal my puppy loves the vet one but hates this waste of money 
product	as a bird lover i was looking for something our teals would enjoy for a long time  yes they do however the quality of this jungle gym is so poor that it started falling apart soon after assembly  it is now 4 months after purchase and the rope pole is actually cracked making that part of the fun useless  maybe for smaller birds this is a great toy but not for larger teal type birds 
health	i have purchased this product 3 times using the monthly subscription process <br  > the first case had multiple tainted bags  by tainted i mean that some portion of the product in the bag had turned to a powder consistency and smelled foul  i did not realize it the first time  and after feeding it to my dog  it made him sick for a few days  i assumed that this was an anomaly  so i removed the bad bags  and let the subscription continue  the second and third cases also had a couple of tainted bags <br  > as i see it  since i am having to throw away multiple bags per case  purchasing this way is not a good deal  instead  i am going back to purchasing cases of this product from sam s club  those cases never had bad bags 
product	i ordered and recieved this treat ball i noticed when i opened the box that it did not appear to be 5\\ inchs i thought ok maybe it just looks this way so i put some kibles food in it and let my golden retreiver have at it  long story made short it got stuck in his mouth and he could not get it loose as advised i was watching him  i was able to get it out of his mouth with out much trouble next i desided i might measure this new toy where it measures at 4\\ inch  so be aware that the package actualy does say 5\\  but is really only 4\\ i will write again with updated photos
health	although my dogs loved these they are very easy to choke on  i have two pomeranians and broke one of these in half i noticed how thick they were and watched both of them carefully as they were eating them  they each ate their share half way and then they could fit the bones fully in their mouths where they could easily get stuck  i thought i could break them down in really tiny pieces so they could at least enjoy the rest of them but  it was impossible to do and i ended up throwing them away  of course they would last a lot longer if you gave each one the entire bone but they are still somewhat too big for my dogs and you would still end up throwing part away <br  ><br  >i was going to give the product one star but  if it wasnt for the choking hazard i think these would be great treats 
health	sad that this company would not not take 10 sec  too look at the merchandise  the treats were green with moldy  i got so sick when i opened  will not buy again  and have already found substitute at petsmart 
health	could not believe that this  has a tiny black loop  attached to side of a dog toy <br  ><br  >didn t understand this  nore did i feel this loop was needed  or safe for puppy  who could pull on black loop    might hurt it is self  never saw a dounut with one  why the dog toy   senseless <br  ><br  >then i was surprised  to find the stupid thing  had a hard plastic  like knot inside of the toy <br  ><br  >i removed loop    after breaking thru seam  as i feared  had to pull a hard knot  from inside    did a quick patch up job  on toy <br  >still  i found strange parts in toy  pup might sink new teething  teeth into <br  ><br  >luckily  this toy  is just a starter <br  >i will not be wasting  any more   or time  on getting worked up over it  just recommend to you  not getting this unassumingly  cute  harmless doggy toy <br  ><br  >zanies may be too appropo  for the company name  not sure  they even know safety rules  or sanctions for animals  but i suggest not chancing your fur pals  health on it <br  ><br  >quality of toy  rather shoddy  as well <br  >disappointing  cute novelity item  but not worth puppy  getting hurt over <br  > so buyer be aware  <br  >love  bb
product	i wish i had read the reviews before i ordered this product   there is something seriously wrong with their system  the picture clearly shows a bag of 10   but i received only one greenie  i even paid extra to have 1 day delivery   only to receive one <br  ><br  > i am returning for credit but will probably be charged return shipping  with no way to find anyone at amazon to listen     
quality	our cats do like these wet food treats  they have not actually told me that  but they come running when they think they are going to get one <br  ><br  >the thing i do not get    why does the packaging need to be so over the top  the 10 pack comes in a thick corrugated cardboard box  presumably becuase they are being shipped ups  but  then each plastic food tray also has a cardboard sleeve around it  why do they need this  it just creates more garbage   <br  ><br  >and of course  just like all wet food  no matter how carefully you open it and put it in a dish  you always get that stinky liquid on your hands  cut down on the packaging and make it easier to open without the thing exploding on your hands 
health	sprinkled the capsule contents on canned cat foor for one cat  and he ate it willingly  sprinkled it on chopped up fresh oregon shrimp for the other cat because he will not eat canned food  he took one sniff and walked off  so had to pin him down and shove a capsule down his throat <br  >bottom line  the stuff works    killed every single flea on them  both cats were sickened and listless for a few days  and almost took them to the vet  but since i had not seen any reviews where a pet died from this stuff  i held off  i treated the whole house with flea busters  and that stuff works too  but make sure you wear your dust mask  cats are happy again  and doing well  its time for their monthly application of frontline today  yet i have seen no live fleas on them <br  >these chicken flavored flea killer capsules are worth the money  half the price of capstar  and they work  i will reserve use for when nothing else seems to be working  however 
product	this item is over priced for the amount that you get  container does not come filled to the top    not even close 
product	food comes out way too fast because there is no external hole adjustment  this was a big mistake on kong s part  normally they have such good and thought out products  i would not buy again <br  ><br  >i gave a 3 because it does work  though not as i wanted and it is well made  durability   get the starmark bob a lot instead  you will be much happier with that product 
product	after reading the good reviews  i bought it  however  my babies  one poodle and one samoyed  they even do not want to try  so totally waste the money  when you buy any treat  you should buy one small package to see whether or not your dogs will like  this is my suggestion 
quality	purchased the roasted chicken flavor and product looks just as pictured  ingredients seems simple enough and the biscuits actually held up well during the shipping  the only problem i have is that my dog does not care for it much  she would eat it if i handed it to her  but the buddy biscuits fail miserably as a motivational tool  if i pull the buddy biscuits out of the box  she would initially look at me then just continue what she was doing earlier  i know all dogs are different with their own tastes  but my dog loves to eat everything edible  and sometimes non edible   to give an idea how her tastes are compared to your dog i will list some items <br  ><br  >she would eat   <br  >dog food brands  does not matter what flavors i tried with each brand   natural balance  avoderm  blue buffalo  orijen  pedigree<br  >veggies  carrots  cabbage  lettuce  bell peppers  chili peppers  i have a chili pepper plant in the yard <br  ><br  >she will not eat   <br  >citrus fruits  lemons and oranges <br  ><br  >basically  i assumed my dog would love to eat any treat and i purchased this because of the ingredients and cost  sadly  i bought it in the 6pack and she is not too fond of the treats  i am giving 3 stars for my situation  but your dog maybe different and love them <br  ><br  >pros <br  > biscuits held up well during shipping<br  > ingredients<br  > cheap<br  ><br  >negative <br  > fails to motivate dog or get her attention<br  ><br  >pros    negative  <br  > dog will eat it     although she would spit it out after i hand it to her  then stare at it  then look at me  and eventually eat it if i do not pull out another type of treat 
quality	the dogs loved the first bag we ordered  the bites were somewhat chewy  the second bag was rock hard so we returned that bag and received a replacement bag that was not much better  they are too hard for the small dogs  the product is great when fresh but i am hesitant to order again 
product	i bought these recently  they do not expire until november so at least they are not old  however  when i opened them and gave one to each of my golden retrievers  they just dropped them  if they have no choice of another treat  they will eat these  but otherwise  they wait for something better  will not buy again since they are not popular here 
product	i have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them  the package i found on amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered  since now i have paid the money and never received the item  and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded  i am not happy  i will be reluctant to purchase from amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement  i contacted ups and they said amazon likes to handle these things directly  and from looking all through amazon s website  it says to contact ups directly  and when i try to put in for a refund  the product not arriving is never an option   and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise  i guess i am out  30 for this purchase  i am disappointed in both amazon and ups for their service  i think if the product arrived  i would have likely been happy with it 
product	i was thoroughly shocked by the price and contents of the blue buffalo wilderness dog jerky treats package   9 99 is too much for 3 5 ounces  i opened the package and there were about 4 square pieces and the rest crumbs  not only that the description did not indicate 3 5 ounces  needless to say i will not be buying this product for my shihtzu again   way too expensive for what you get 
product	i am sorry i cannot use the word useless twenty times in a row to describe this product  it is a total waste of money  my dog seems to hate the flavor or at best not be interested at all  save your money and buy something else
product	i agree with one of the other reviewers  the language and pictures are vague  \\ 3pk 6 inch\\  and the picture shows multiple packs  you think you are getting three packs  each with three inside  so a total of nine <br  ><br  >you only get one pack with three pieces   so  11 55 for only three thin six inch pieces           this is a super rip off    <br  ><br  >also  the seller claims that the language is clear  well  if there is any doubt  instead of trying to defend themselves  why do not they just edit the words and pictures so that buyers know exactly what they are getting  this is the simple answer 
product	my four cats go totally bonkers over the purebites chicken breast treats but they walk away from the purebites whitefish treats  i can put some fish treats in a bowl and by the next day  they will eventually get eaten  i am going to test purebites product guarantee and return these fish treats for a promised refund 
product	i have been ordering these very same dog ears for about 3 years  this last shipment cost more  and most of all  are half the size of what they were  they are now 3 4\\   they were 6 8\\   very disappointed  will look for alternative the next time 
product	i just rec d the chicken one today 8 2 12 i always always ck the dates of everything i eat or drink  for my furbabies too   i cannot believe the  one  time i did not  thank goodness only gave one treat each to each dog  i couldn t believe it the date said   best  used  by 7 13 12     all dates on everything always is a year to two yrs away  so this had to be very old  how could they send something that old  grrr<br  >however the co immediately refunded me   but  im out treats for my girls have to wait for another kind of treat to arrive now  <br  >i would refrain ordering from this co 
quality	bought the big box to be economical  bad choice  my dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another  and this was over months  i gave them to a friend  my friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these  so i am not sad that my dog did not like them 
health	when i got these in the mail last saturday and opened them up  put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of  offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death  we have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese  so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and i were both excited  then that afternoon for her last dose for the day  same performance  we thought we had found the answer to our prayers as she has a disease that cannot be cured if she does not take this medication until it is all gone  so this was a godsend <br  ><br  >but  the very next morning  before she had anything else to eat  my wife tried to give her a pill using a pocket and she turned her nose up at it and walked away   she tried several times with varying amounts of the pocket cut off to make it smaller for her and easier to gulp down  still no go  so we waited a couple of hours  without feeding her anything at all  tried again  same thing <br  ><br  >so i saw a bag of pockets in walmart and the only thing they had besides beef was duck so i tried that  same thing  would not even eat one so we are back to looking for something else that might work  if your dog will eat them they are great  
quality	i am extremely disappointed in this product  i have a 43lb pointer mix  so i always get the largest sizes of these types of treat toys  i bought the \\ over 50 pound\\  version  thinking it would last my dog that much longer  well  the toy comes as pictured  pre assembled with 2 cookies on it and an additional 2 for later  i gave the toy to my dog to entertain him while i showered after getting home from work one day  30 minutes later  i come back downstairs to find that he has finished off the cookies  i am a little disappointed  but i figure that maybe it lasted him the entire 30 minutes  giving the toy the benefit of the doubt <br  ><br  >unfortunately  this is not the case  i just gave the toy to my dog again tonight with the other 2 cookies on it  he proceeded to grasp the toy between his front paws and in under a minute  had bitten one cookie in half and it fell off the toy  he then ate the cookie and was already halfway through the toy in under 2 minutes  he just finished off the second cookie in the same manner  biting the cookie so it breaks in half and then just eating the cookie  and he has had the toy a grand total of less than 5 minutes  so much for entertainment value  i was really hoping for a sturdier cookie that he would gnaw on instead of just bite  break and eat <br  ><br  >i only purchased this toy because it was so cheap on amazon  it costs upwards of  25 for the 50  lb size at petsmart petco  but i got it for less than  10 here on amazon  i will not be purchasing refills  as they are not going to be worth the money unless i can get them dirt cheap  in which case i may attempt to coat the cookies in peanut butter or canned dog food and freeze them to potentially encourage licking first instead of biting and chewing <br  ><br  >2 stars since my dog seemed to enjoy the cookies  and now he is gnawing on the empty bone itself  though i am inclined to take it away soon since i am worried about him breaking a tooth on the extremely hard plastic  it is much harder than a traditional nylabone  not soft or rubbery at all  <br  ><br  >looks like it is back to frozen goody filled kongs and the everlasting treat ball  my trusty fall back plans 
health	this product did not work the fleas seemed to become sluggish for a short period of time but they did not die my dogs are still infested 
product	be aware that the item you will receive is not chicken strips as pictured  plato no longer makes chicken strips  but rather formed pieces which are called plato organic chicken and sold for less on amazon  the seller would take no responsibility for the wrong picture  nor would they refund to me the difference between what i thought i bought  and the other product  which they also sell  for less 
health	my husband and i are pretty busy people  and there is nothing i hate more than spending what little free time we have running to the pet store to get pet food  with amazon subscribe and save  we are able to get this delivered right to our front door at the same  or lower  cost of running to the pet store or market <br  ><br  >this particular formula seems to be fine for our 2 spoiled felines  we switch them back and forth between this  chicken and rice  and indoor formula and i have not seen an increase or decrease in hairball activities  they seems to still have the occassional hairball  but i think that is pretty typical <br  >for the price i feel that this brand and formula provide a good diet and nutrients that our furbabies need 
product	my dog is ho hum about these treats  do not be fooled by the picture   the package is very small and the treats themselves look like and have the consistency of styrafoam packaging peanuts  i love halo s other dog treats  especially the little baked snacks  for  9 95  i really do not feel this is a good value at all  disappointed 
health	our dogs love these jerky treats and while they state they are completely healthy they are made in china  i almost died when someone asked me and i took out the bag and there it was     made in china  i always thought dogswell were in the usa so i am very disappointed with that <br  ><br  >with that said   the jerky treats seem like actual jerky  we have a malti poo with stomach issues and she does not digest them well  so we do opt for the rice   lamb treats which seem to break apart and digest easier for her  for instance  where i can snap a rice lamp piece into smaller pieces with ease this chicken breast jerky has to ripped and torn and it is stringy  almost like tendons in it <br  ><br  >the dogs devour them though so i keep them for the little one and give the older mp the rice lamb 
product	same comment as previous reviewer  only rec d 1 bag not 30  weight is 3 5 oz not 7 9 lbs as advertised  rip off    asin b005vbmmrw pop n  bites choice cubes dog treats  30 count  
quality	i buy this brand for my grandmother s cat  i do not like that it includes so many additives and biproducts  but her cat does not seem to care  he actually seems to prefer it  i prefer to buy organic for my cat  but i am a bit of a snob when it comes to such things 
product	when i bought this food  i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price   1 less per bag than the grocery store  for low grade cat food  the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying  45 for 6 18lb  bags   a good deal  when i received six 3 6lb bags  i thought there had been a mistake  nope  so  i spend  40  returning it  i bought three 6 packs   oops  and now ozbo customer service tells me they take 2 3 weeks processing returns  my kitties need food now  and these people want to sit on my  180 for that long  do not buy from these scammers    
product	i have a labrador mix puppy named  max  he is high energy and constantly needs to be busy  i bought the product in hopes to help w his teething and keeping him occupied  max  was able to remove eat the treats w in a day and a half  this may be a good product for a purse dog  but definitely not medium size to large dogs  for the price of the ball and its treats  it was not worth the money paid 
product	i have purchased the name brand products in the past and had great success with them  after attempting to save some money to treat a stray that found its way to my house  i bought the flea killer for small dogs cats  this product is totally useless  after experiencing my dogs reaction to capstar  fleas falling off dead within 30 minutes  i am highly disappointed in a product that claimed to be  just as effective   this product seems to simply be a pet owner placebo  basically give your dog a pill so you will feel better about controlling your pet s fleas  i have seen several reviews where claims of ineffectiveness are blamed on the dog s breed  whatever  i have 3 different types and sizes and this product does not work on any of them  and i am using it in conjunction with the company s alternative to program  a month into it and the fleas are as bad as ever and it looks like i will have to buy the real deal anyway  save yourself the time and headache   just buy what you know and what you can trust which is definitely not this product  
product	as a previous reviewer stated  the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog s nose mouth to reach the treat  the very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding  i did not think this would happen as she is not a large dog with a big snout  30 lb  cocker spaniel mix    her snout is longer and thinner than an average cocker  it would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before i purchased this  i measured it myself and it is about 1 5\\  deep  2 1 8\\  wide and 2 1 4\\  long  seems big enough  but it wasn t  additionally  only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat  the other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog s face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face  i was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats  but i could not let it continue with her being cut  good game concept  but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded  i am returning this tomorrow 
product	my two little conures love these even more then see  they make for a good balanced diet  however  they did not come sealed properly  there is a hole in the top and i have no idea how long it has been like that  they are very stale and just not as fresh as expected  luckily my birdies are smart enough to dip them in water so that they are able to consume them  overall i would buy these again but not online so i can inspect the package 
product	very disappointed in this product  since it is not made of real wood but rather particle board it started looking bad after about 1 2 hour with my dog playing with it  it was getting all wet because he was so excited and he was salivating more than normal trying to get at the treats  the concept is good if only the quality was better  of course this dog weighs in at more than 100 lbs so maybe for a small dog would last longer 
product	my dogs love these  but when i looked on the package to see where they came from  i had to pull off a sticker on the back  and in very small print it say made in china  very disapointing  to say the least  especially when they were clearly trying to hide that fact 
health	my dog absolutley loves these treats  however  they are made in china  there have been a lot of reports lately about dogs getting sick from treats  especially chicken jerky treats  made in china  i never heard that this brans is a problem  but i am not taking any chances 
product	i have 2 cats  they \\ need\\  to eat wet food according to my vet because one of them is not getting enough water  i do not want to buy them mcfakefood from the grocery store <br  ><br  >both my cats will eat this and they are pretty picky  the directions say to feed them 3 1 3 cans per day each cat  mine eat 2 each per day and are fine but even then  that is 4 cans per day  that means one case only lasts 6 days   5 cases per month   over  150  that is pricey  wtf 
health	this is some of the lowest protein dry food available for kitties with crf <br  ><br  >i used this flavor as well as the pork flavor for my feral queen whose kidneys failed  like the hill s k d and purina n f  this does not have meat as the first or second ingredient  it is lower protein than the royal canin pork flavor  too  but  unlike the k d and n f  my cat would eat this stuff  and it did not seem to make her sick <br  ><br  >word to the wise  if you are feeding dry food to a crf kitty  make sure she has lots and lots and lots of fresh clean water available  i know you are always having to balance what is the better food versus what she will eat at all   otherwise she starts having liver problems as well as the crf  so this is maybe a good food to keep available  since it seems to be among the most palatable and least harmful <br  ><br  >you can buy it on amazon without a prescription  but most vets will write you one  i ve heard stories of vets refusing to write for any brands except the ones they personally carry    62  this is a red flag for you and your kitty  
health	i have purchased chicken chips in the past and they were not from china  shortly after purchasing this order my dog became sick  i cannot say it was from this order of chicken chips but he got sick shortly after i started feeding him this order of chicken chips  i had to pay a  500 vet bill when my dog had blood in his urine  the vet could not determine what caused the urinary tract infection  my sister told me to check the container to see if the product came from china  it did  she gave me a different bag of the same product that was made in the usa  check your packaging 
health	my cats in general do like purina catfoods  this one is no exception  will not buy anymore  still looking for good catfood that my cats will actually eat without throwing up 
product	i got the medium size for both my 20 pound corgis  i put each in a crate with one of these  brand new  in three hours when i came home there were no more treats  not really everlasting  but now i just put yogurt and peanut butter in and freeze them for a treat to keep them busy  the refills are just too expensive when they go so fast  they did not chew the holder up yet  so that is a plus  i got them for a bargain price so that is the only reason i bought  pet stores are charging way too much for these 
health	these did not work out for my little poodle  she started choking on them  i cleared a rough  hard piece out of her throat and then threw them out   omg  never again 
product	i bought this for my newfoundland who just had knee surgery  looking for toys that will stimulate her mentally but not tax her physically  this toy seems very sturdy and she likes trying to get the treats out <br  ><br  >the part i cannot figure out  and there are no instructions or pictures  is how to get the treats in  if you look at the pictures  the treats coming out look like small dog biscuits  however  the hole in the middle will take treats no bigger than a large piece of kibble  very frustrating  i want to pry the toy open but am afraid i will break it <br  ><br  >i d recommend the kong genius toys if you want to be able to put a small biscuit or anything larger than kibble inside   
product	what the heck  <br  >why sell for the same price as before but with 30 tablets less  <br  ><br  >that s price gouging after it has been out of stock quite awhile then repackaged like this   <br  >no way   losing a good customer   
product	greenies 36 ounce dental chews value tub regular size with 36 chews in package is actually more per chew than the same item in the 27 ounce package  where is the value or savings in buying the larger package of chews  the 27 oz package cost per chew is 0 78 cents each chew the 36 oz package is 0 85 cents per chew  why buy the larger tub for more money  am i missing something here  great product though just misleading price and value advertising  3 stars only because of the misleading value advertising 
product	i have gotten these from my local pet store  and am very picky about getting the tallest  fattest one i can locate  recently the price for one jumped from  2 99 to  4 99  which is ridiculous for a chew stick that lasts no longer than 24 hours  on a good day  i learned of this \\ economy package\\  and though there is many  many negative reviews  i thought i would give them a whirl  well  i am now in the market for new bull dicks altogether  exactly half of them were 6\\  tall and the 12\\  tall ones were completely anemic  i myself  if this was my business  would be embarrassed to sell this product  there is clearly no quality control  i cannot speak to odor  as i have not opened the package yet  so i cannot comment on that  maybe that would knock off the last star possible 
quality	i too have rec the new formula for the true chews chicken jerky fillets  it is smells horrible and looks more like jerky than dried compressed chicken fillets  i will not buy this product again  i guess i will have to start buying smokehouse  beware  smokehouse products may show made in usa  front of pkg  made in china  on back of pkg   there are smokehouse products that show usa on both front and back  if your looking for usa always check the pkg both front and back 
health	i bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the u s a  they are so hard  my dog cannot chew them  and if i break them  which is hard to do   i am afraid she will choke on them  there are not very many \\ strips\\   mostly pieces  it is a wasted  22 99  as i will not give them to her  how can you sell something so dangerous 
product	these might work well for training  but they are way to tiny for a treat   you have to give them a whole handful  i was disappointed 
health	do not buy this if your looking for reliable tick control  i tried k9 advantix ii for two months on my dog  she is 59 pounds and i used the product for dogs  55 lbs  k9 advantix ii does not work  just three days after applying  closely following the directions  several ticks were found on in my dog  she now has anaplasmosis  similar to lymes disease  and i cannot help but wonder if this product had performed as advertised  if it would have been avoided  very disappointed and will never purchase this again 
quality	what can i say  maybe my dog is particular  but he does not like it  the package is still unopened  since he does not really play with the \\ interactive bone\\   there is no need for the re fill 
product	all turtles will go bananas for shrimp or anything that smells fishy  this food is great  i usually place my turtle in a separate container during feeding  i do have to point out that the cranberries are massive and float away real easy  my turtle is about 8 inches long and does not really bother with the cranberries anymore  it is a good size for the price  i recommend this to anyone that wants to give variety to their water baby 
health	my picky cat loves these so although they seem a little pricey  i will continue to buy them  she is so hard to please and it makes meal times much less frustrating when she does not sniff and walk away  i only wish it had the vitamins for a complete meal  because of that i only give them to her a couple times a week  otherwise  i think she would love these everyday <br  >update 6 21 2012 mabel has been eating these but all of a sudden they are making her sick  not sure exactly what to think but i will not be serving them anymore 
health	normally  these treats are moist   chewy  but these are dry  hard  and stale  these are the only type of treat my golden can eat because he has allergies  i guess we will have to return to purchasing them locally 
quality	i need some soft treats for reinforcement    this is definitely not it   <br  >it is hard like rock candy  and my dogs turn their nose up at this product    will not eat it   
health	as others have mentioned  my dog also got very teary eyed and vomited every time  i gave my dog a few days to recover   then gave the treats again just to make sure and sure enough  same symptoms  i know your pets go crazy over these but please    do not risk it 
quality	the minute i opened the box  i knew i had bought the wrong item  my dogs do not like this item  probably because it is very hard and my chihuahuas have very small teeth  so i am sorry but i will not buy this product again unless i get new dogs 
health	this product was a pain to use  the packets do not totally dissolve which is dangerous for ponds containing fish  in addition  my pond had never had an issue with phosphate levels but they suddenly spiked through the roof after both times i used the product and i had to purchase anther product to quickly correct the issue  i called the company to complain about this product and two others which did not do what they promised and they basically blew me off   sent me a single gallon of another product after i had purchased hundreds of dollars in their products with no results  that is not standing behind your products 
product	i cannot really tell  it is very thick and rough on the dogs coat and do not get it on the floor or carpet  its difficult to vacuum up  anyway  at this point i will try anything  i will use this for the outdoor play area where the dogs play during the day 
product	they are great treats but my dogs were never interested in spending time trying to get food out of something  they do play with the toy that is suggested to use with the treats  but just as a ball  there was nothing wrong with the product  just not a good choice for my dogs  and very expensive to use just as treats  which we did 
quality	i assumed potato and fish treats would be softer  these are hard treats  i gave my two bags to a repairman who happened to be fixing something in my house  maybe his dog will like them  mine sure didn t  my bichon frise would not go near them  she actually spit them out 
product	our pups ate these  although they were not entirely enthusiastic about them at first  but i would not deduct points for that necessarily  what i am concerned about is after i gave them each a chew  i noticed on the bag that these are not suitable for dogs under 9 months  i did not see this mentioned on the product page  and i emailed the company to find out why  is it an issue with a certain ingredient  digestibility  etc    but have yet to receive a response  i have two 7 5 month  50  lb dogs  so i am not too worried about the issue  but i would like to get an answer before i give them more  this note should be on the product page  as well as in larger print on the package  it s only listed in the fine print on the back  if it is necessary to note in the first place 
health	i was looking around for duck based treats because my lab has allergies and eats a duck based food  i ordered these    and shame on me for not reading all the reviews first    i was just surprised to see a duck treat <br  ><br  >what was more irritating when the package arrived i could not find the country of origin label    which is a legal requirement  some one had purposely stuck a new bar code on top of the produced in china printing that said it was a new product  and when you tried to take the sticker off it fell into pieces and you really had to work at getting it uncovered with your fingernail  this was premeditated mislabeling that should not be permitted on amazon    <br  ><br  >given all the health concerns it should have been clearly marked it was china material <br  ><br  >i am not sure what i am going to do    toss it all out is most likely and call it a not so cheap lesson that i need to be more careful <br  ><br  >i thought amazon too steps to police it is sellers    evidently not so much 
quality	they are as hard as steel   i purchased the small size for my 40 lb dog  i gave him one and watched him  he was struggling so i took it and attempted to break it in half  i am 34 years old and 240 lbs and i could barely break it in half  there is no way i was letting my dog chew on it  he would have no teeth left  much too hard   save your money and find and clean up an old piece of steel instead  please be careful if you give these to your pet 
health	i have had to treat ich many times over the course of my life and have had 100  success with no loss of fish using the heat salt treatment  i recently had an outbreak in one of my tanks that i did not have a heater in so i decided to have this medicine overnighted and give it a try  after reading all the reviews i figured it had to work  after 5 days of treatment  following the directions on the bottle exactly  the ich not only was not cured but had spread to more fish and one of my glass catfish was dead  i immediately did a 50  water changed and but the carbon back in my filters and started turning up the heat and adding salt  after about 2 days i had the heat to 88f and 2 tbs salt 5gallons and 3 days after that there was no sign of ich and i had not lost any more fish  this medication is not only a waste of money but it is also harmful to fish  i have used the heat salt treatment with all sorts of fish  including ones they say do not like salt  such as plecos and cory s  and have never lost a fish and always got rid of the ich that way  do yourself and your fish a favore and do not put this poison in your tank 
product	when my dog was a puppy i bought her the medium size  she is a golden retriever and i used the medium until she was around 30 lbs  at that point with her puppy teeth  she would slowly chew these  she had bad puppy breath and these helped a ton with that  however  i bought her the large size when this box ran out and she no longer chewed them slowly  she would finish one in under four minutes with no change in the smell of her breath  we brush her teeth and she has other chews that last much longer but her teeth were white with no plaque while using these  if your dog is a slow chewer and has bad breath these are worth it  otherwise they are fairly expensive for a quick treat 
health	this is a good quality grain free doggie treat  the product has a strong hickory smoky fish smell upon opening the bag which was not so pleasant at first  i have two shih tzu puppies and they are not picky eaters so they enjoyed these treats  they do have sensitive stomachs and these treats appear not to irritate their tummies  i was a little disappointed to find out after purchasing this product that the company natural balance has had product recalls in the past  i believe these treats are produced in the usa and quality control has improved  i may try other products by this manufacture in the future 
health	i was happy to find a dry food that checked all the boxes for nutrition and health issues  and my cat loved the flavor and devoured it  but then she threw up the undigested food within half hour of eating <br  ><br  >my vet thinks the problem is that it contains corn  which is not digestible for my cat 
product	i have two 3 year old cats one female  luna  one male  titan      i used to buy crappy supermarket treats just to give them something different    we rarely give them treats    but a year ago my vet told me luna might have dental issues in the future  i was hoping to get something that would make them chew more  bc they jus swallow everything and their getting a lot of tartar build up  but this did not work as well as i wished  if you guys have any recomendations     please let me know   
quality	i also ended up throwing it out cause it is too hard  which makes it an ankle breaker at night if you should happen to step on it  nice idea  but my cats gave this one a 3 out of 5  and my fear of stepping on it at night gave it less than that 
product	well my cats loved the food however be warned that each bag is not the 3 15 pounds that it says in the title  that is the combined weight of the three little bags that you get  here i thought i was getting a great deal so needless to say i will never buy these again  i will be going to the regular grocery store for the larger bags 
product	granted  i have two dogs who are spoiled rotten and expect the best  these are not the best  neither dog likes them  i have a german shepherd and a cavachon  i thought they would enjoy these treats after reading the other reviews  they would not even take them from me  for me  they were a waste of money 
health	one of my dogs has food allergies  so buffalo  actually bison  is a good alternative to cow products  i had tried canine caviar california rolls at my local holistic pet store before i purchased them here and found them to be suitable for an average chewer as a good occasional chew  lasting anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes  <br  ><br  >the best aspect of these treats is the price on amazon  at my local pet store  they sold for  3 99 each  since the price here is almost 80  off retail at less than  1 00 each  they are an extremely good deal <br  ><br  >the only problem  however  is that the batch that i ordered stinks to high heaven  do not get me wrong  i was prepared for some stinkiness  given that i have purchased these before and am aware that this is a natural animal product  these came packaged each individually wrapped in plastic  then placed in larger plastic bags  then placed in a display box and they still smell like concentrated bison sweat through the packaging  once you open it  you will need an iron stomach to not retch  of course  the dogs think that they are a to die for delicacy and relish them all the more <br  ><br  >i believe that the manufacturer probably needs to allow these to dry out a little more before packaging them  all of the individual wrapping may actually be sealing in moisture that is causing the excessive stink  if the manufacturer were to address the smell by drying them out more  adjust the packaging and include desiccant packs  i would definitely become a repeat customer  however  i am not sure that the amazing price is worth the stench of these  i will probably go with another product once we have gotten rid of these california rolls 
health	my family has four dachshunds and they all gobbled up these treats  one of my dachshunds developed an allergy to these treats after i went through 2 bags  he got hives and this throat swelled up  we caught it fast and got him to the vet  he had to take benadryl for a few days  he is just fine now  but i cannot risk feeding my dogs these treats anymore <br  ><br  >before anyone questions  i know they were these treats because he had one small reaction before the big one  the big reaction was right after i fed one of these treats and he had no other treats as these were the only ones that i had on hand 
product	i ordered this since we are not anywhere near a store that sells these  shipping was fast but this item looked like it was used  the top was scratched and there is a sticky spot where a sticker must have been removed  this was to set out on our kitchen island with puppy treats and it looks awful  wished i had waited until we were out of town to purchase at a store  it is super cute  not worth  9 since target has the bigger size for  6  i will be getting that one 
quality	these are terrible smelling  rancid  and hard  they are not pure turkey  there are other ingredients and if your dog is not able to have grains then do not buy this  i ordered two and they will both go in the trash  what a waste of money  worse item i have ever gotten from amazon 
health	one of my girl friends suggested using this for ear infections  i bought it and used it every day for about a week and nothing  it might have worked for her dogs  it did nothing for mine  i had to bring him to the vet and he said he had a mild yeast infection in his ears and gave him ko dtops  prescription   he asked how often i was cleaning his ears with the solution of half vinegar and half alcohol  i said twice a month  the vet said to clean his ears evry three days with that solution<br  >dee
quality	i am so picky about what i feed my cats  but my one super finicky cat will only eat this food when she is not feeling well  she is the weakest of my 3 babies in that way and you know how it is   you do anything to make them feel better  this has been on the shelf for several years now just for those times when she will not eat anything else   until today  i opened a can from a new case of food and it was totally different than any other cans she has eaten  instead of nice white chunks of fish  it is mostly brown and smells awful   not spoiled  just different in a bad way  she would not eat it  the whole case is packed up to go back to the store and i will not buy it again  she loves the natural value tuna with toppings too  so i guess that will have to suffice  very disappointing when they change a good thing  
quality	all three of my dogs turned their noses up to these  i would not recommend them  they felf dry and crumbly  nothing like i expected 
product	i put this on my dogs as soon as it came and i have used this kind of product before and this brand has not worked as well as the other ones i have used    i am very disappointed in the way it worked 
health	these bull sticks carry the same name brand as the costco standard  cadet bully stick  but are not as uniform in shape or nearly as large  instead of smelling like dead animal  these bull sticks smell like dirty underwear  the smell did not bother my dog    at least at first  my dog threw up each time after chewing consuming the bull sticks  her dumb owner  me  was not sure what was making her sick at first  so we had three opportunities through the week to chew and clean up  the rest of the bag went to the dumpster <br  ><br  >if your dog has a sensitive stomach or anyone in the family has a sensitive nose  avoid these rawhide chews 
health	these treats are really smelly and i could live with that if my dog actually liked them  she will rarely eat them  most of the time she will not even take it when it is offered but if she does  i usually find it sitting around on her bed  i am still looking for a replacement for the chicken jerky that she loves but i cannot feed her because it comes from china and has made too many dogs sick  i will keep trying to find a treat she likes  this one definitely was not it 
health	although i ordered the 6 pack for dogs  i received a 6 pack for cats      i had originally ordered a single puppy tube  and based on my puppy s willingness to consume more dry food when i added this thick paste to her food  i thought i would save some money and reorder in bulk  i do not know what surprised me more  that i received the wrong product  or that the list of ingredients was the same on the tube for puppies and for cats  the puppy likes it  and it does help me get her to eat more of her food  so i will buy it again if she shows a decrease in appetite  it is a very thick paste that you can squeeze over food  you can mix it in the bowl  or allow it to melt onto the food  there are no serving size directions  so i just use a quick squeeze and let her eat it from the top of her food 
product	unfortunately  for the safety of our pets we will no longer feed them any treats made processed in china  this treat  while a great size for cats  is in fact made in china  real shame i did not know that before buying it for my cats 
quality	my 1 1 2 yr old boston will not touch these  the mean greenz version that is  first food i beleve he has ever turned his nose up at 
product	my cat refused to scratch the post  when he did  he did not have the power or the intellect to push the product down  instead i was doing it for him  if you see the product pic is lopsided  it will get to that every time you get frustrated and push down on the unit yourself  it will get more slanted the more you push it yourself  you will also get irritated seeing a lopsided feeder in your room  not recommended for purchase  there are better alternatives to food holders 
product	our 3 dogs love these  they actually do a little dance before settling down to eat it <br  >so way only three stars <br  >well  there is way too much packaging  and emails to cs at natro and a letter to the ceo have all gone unanswered 
product	dog loved it and tried to chew it like a regular kong  it was very cute her turning it on end to try and find the opening as in a regular kong  it seemed to stand up to some serious chewing as long as it stayed together  however  there are too few turns to tighten it securely enough so with all the paw action she easily unscrewed it every time  i turned my back once  in the first 2 days  and she had gotten it apart and used the top portion as a serious chew toy  never to be screwed on to the bottom portion again <br  >i only give it 3 stars because she liked the product so well right out of the package  it is really worthy one  or no  star because i was only able to leave the room momentarily before it was destroyed 
product	very disappointed  based on all of the reviews  i was ecstatic thinking that my little shiba inu was going to love these  first off  he does not really have a taste for them  so i have just been giving them away to friends who also have dogs  secondly  and most importantly  i have found that some of the pig ears have markings on them  like green marker permanently marked on the slivers  others have hair stuck to them  like old man ear hair    it is the grossest thing i have ever seen in my life and now cannot get the image that has been permanently burned into my mind or the memory of the feeling of the hairs off of my hands  i cannot believe that these hairs were not removed or that this part of the pig ear was not discarded  i cannot believe that this was packaged and sold to dog owners  this is as disgusting as feeding your domesticated pet the non meat part of animals such as the nails  eyes  beaks  etc  be careful in choosing the product that you decide to buy and feed your beloved pet  
product	quick delivery but after reading the info packed with the product about the packaging to keep the cost down  etc  i also noticed that the pills were capsules  not tablets like capstar and got very skeptical about using them  i thought they would be capstar tablets  bought in bulk and just repackaged  i still haven t used the capsules  and ultimately bought capstar   seller was reliable and delivery was prompt 
health	i initially gave this product a glowing review  i m leaving it posted below so you can see what i had to say  <br  ><br  >but now the price has more than doubled  and there is not a snowball s chance in hell i am paying  26 for a bag of chicken jerky <br  ><br  >my original review <br  ><br  >after reading the news articles about dogs getting sick from eating chicken jerky from china  i started searching for a usa made replacement for my golden retriever s jerky treats  it was really hard to find any that were not made in china  and be careful  because there is even one product on amazon whose name implies it is made in america  but it is not <br  ><br  >these treats are made in the usa  however  and my dog loves them  a large bag costs basically the same as the wagon train treats i used to give her  by the way  wagon train was one of the manufacturers associated with making dogs sick   and they provide free delivery  even for just one bag  you really cannot beat that <br  ><br  >as for other reviews saying they are crumbly  i think that is a little nit picky  do not worry  they are not going to make a mess or anything like that  and my dog has yet to complain     <br  ><br  >if you want to save a dollar  and give your dog slightly less crumbly chews  and possibly kidney failure as well   by all means buy wagon train chicken jerky  i am sticking with these 
product	i did not look at the case of dog food when it arrived too carefully  when i started to feed it to my dog i found that half of the cans were dented  not a big deal  at least not until i got to the cans that were dented so badly that they had lost the seal  it was all moldy at the top and i had to throw those ones out  my dog does love this  but then he loves all canned food i have given him  i bought this because it is one of very few canned dog foods that are meant for puppies  and it was one of the most affordable ones too  i was disappointed that the food comes all ground up in a paste  some of the adult purina canned foods have actual pieces of meat and rice that you can see  there is usually a picture of what it looks like on the back   i have also read up on some of the ingredients here and i am going to switch to another brand with better ingredients and with ingredients that i can actually see  even if it means feeding my dog an adult formula  purina is not bad  but if you can afford to spend a little more there are much better brands out there 
health	tiger barb still has white spot on used for a week so<br  >i would not recommend to use it to whole aquarium<br  >i suggest people who are having their fish white spot disease or others  take out your fish  put it in another tank  do other treatment<br  >the parasite in the tank can be treated with filter  biological  chemical  and mechanical filtration helps a lot  or you can put your money on uv light  even more effective for disease prevention <br  >this product is<br  >stressful to my fish                          
product	this is advertised as being a vegan dog treat product  but it is definitely not vegan  its amazon title even has the word  \\ vegan\\  in it  \\ kong premium treats sweet potato vegan treats\\   i ordered one of these  and gelatin is in the ingredient list  gelatin is not vegan <br  ><br  >the product does not contain any animal \\ by products\\   rendered meat  and even says so on the package  i think that is what confused the person who labeled it \\ vegan\\  <br  ><br  >ingredients  sweet potatoes  barley flour  brown rice flour  maple syrup  vegetable glycerine  gelatin  my emphasis   natural flavor  salt  carrots  peas  phosphoric acid  sorbic acid  citric acid  natural smoke flavor  mixed tocopherols  rosemary <br  ><br  >and if i were nitpicking  i would say the natural flavor and natural smoke flavor could also be non vegan  i cannot say for sure <br  ><br  >the use of acids in this is also a little weird  i do not usually see three used  and phosphoric acid is not typically in dog treats  i do not think  it is just odd <br  ><br  >i also think it is odd that they used maple syrup  since it tends to cost a lot more than fructose syrup  i guess they suspect people avoid fructose syrup or hfcs  but maple syrup is just another sweetener  probably just as \\ bad\\  as hfcs <br  ><br  >other info  \\ crude protein  no less than 6 0   crude fat  no less than 1 0   crude fiber  no more than 4 0   moisture  no more than 28 0  \\ <br  ><br  >anyway  just wanted to chime in to mention that it is not vegan like the title says <br  ><br  >hope that helps 
product	i have purchased the 3 types of treats thru subscribe and save  they are no longer supplied by amazon and i am not surprised  you can still obtain them from other vendors on amazon  be aware they look nothing like the product pictured  the quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best  the apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple more like little sponges and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color  it is beyond hard  whats with this  the ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast  beware these treats are made in china   i cringe to think what may have been substituted <br  ><br  >there was no notice by amazon that these came from china known for manufacturing deadly dog products  i would never have purchased them  i suggest you do not either  my dog no longer eats them  i have nearly  100 of product  i cannot with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows  inquire as to the country of origin before you buy   \\ distributed by\\  does not count  there are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state  made in america  
quality	my cat deemed these treats fit for hockey games only  he would not eat them  but had no problems shooting them under my couch 
quality	thought i would try this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive prescription diet my vet recommended  researched further   added canned food  cranberry supplement    water fountain  no problems so far   feel much better that my cats are back on their meat base food  this stuff even smells bad  was worried since a purina brand   i normally do not buy any of these poor quality foods  but tried it 
quality	our dachshund was not interested in this at all  it might have been the size  but we did get the smaller one  unfortunately  it turned out to be a waste of money for our dog  we found a rubber one at a pet supply store that she loves  so it might be the hard plastic she did not like  do not really know  but she did not use it at all 
product	beware made in china  i will not buy any dog treat made outside the united states  i am not saying there is nothing wrong with these but i love my dog too much to risk their health  amazon should include what country dog treats are made in and will not buy any online from amazon unless they state this information or a review includes it 
product	our lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids  but the angle of the treat pod is such that she cannot fit her snout  or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food  even turning her snout sideways did not help  the idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking  we will keep trying but it does not really hold her interest since she cannot get the reward 
health	i ordered this for my 17 year old cat  she only has one tooth and is very finicky  she will only eat the seafood pate of friskies  i thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than walmart and i could have it delivered to my house for a free price  i thought this was a good idea <br  >well  i was wrong <br  >my housemate and i wondered what that godawful smell was  after weeks of dealing with cockroaches scurrying under furniture and fruit flies perching everywhere  i found out where they were breeding  one of the cans arrived banged up and maggots decided to call it home  you think fresh cat food smells bad <br  >i brought home a premature infant and was afraid of all of the germs that infested the place at the time  i did not want a single risk posed to him getting sick  so i kept him in his room until i found out where the funk was coming from <br  >the moral of this story is unless you do not mind infestation and possible contamination  do not order cat food online 
quality	i wanted an enrichment toy for my 5lb chihuahua who usually loves all things treat inspired  i thought this would be a perfect fit  however  the smallest size offered   3 inches   is still too big for her  that coupled with the noise the plastic ball makes on our wood floors  and i end up with a frightened dog  she will not go near it no matter what i fill it with  in fact  she runs away from it  i would love to find something like this in rubber and a little smaller <br  ><br  >as for the item itself  it appears fairly well made and the opening to allow the treats to flow into the clear section of the ball is adaptable 
quality	thought they were okay at first  they seemed a little more oily than normal  by time i got to bottom of bag the last 4 5 ears had a weird molding stuff on them  ended up throwing away  may have just been a bad batch  probably came from china  i think the chinese have some sort of conspiracy to kill our dogs  seems to be a lot of recalls over dog treats that come from china <br  ><br  >my newest batch came from some good old boys in iowa  i am feeling a lot better about them  few more bucks  but hey  my pets are my kids 
product	this product came in bad condition it looked used and when i tried to open it  it was a pain to open and once i did i felt like it did not really have the have suction  i ended up returning this 
product	my dog loves them  but i originally bought them because i wanted to switch over from the jerkey treats out of china  for clarification these treats are not jerkey    my dog gobbles them in about 1 5 seconds but she is greatful  the best part about them is they are made in the usa so no worries about poisining  the cons are they are expensive for what you get  but i guess anything in the us is going to be more expensive than china  i would rather support local than china anyday     
quality	i bought these to make feeding my cat her daily pill easier on her and me  but she will not eat them so i am back to shoving the pill down her throat again  my dog will eat them though so that is why i will give this product 3 stars 
health	i read that chicken jerky from china is dangerous for dogs so i was looking for another treat they would eat  this was not one of them  it did not matter how hungry they got  they would not eat these  they sat on the floor two days  i picked them up  threw them away and then tried again a few days later with fresh treats  i left them in their treat spots  they sat there for days  they would not eat them  it does not help if they were made in america but my dogs find them unpalatable 
quality	after reading recent article in the new york times  i was excited to get this food for my finicky kitty  purchased the variety pack since i wanted to test out his preference  he pretty much hated them all  some  he just sniffed  looked at  meowed at me and would not go near  a few smelled pretty awful as well 
quality	my guy stopped eating the feces as long as he was taking it  but started again a few days after he stopped taking it  had to treat both of my dogs  was looking for a more permanent solution 
quality	i have small dogs and one of these treats is far too large for them  plus the one smaller dog does not have the jaws to even break through these since they are too hard  we broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste  but they are too much work to purchase again  i am happy that they seemed to love a low fat treat   but if you have small dogs   you may want to get these instead    asin b004b9ch4s old mother hubbard mother s solutions snacks for dogs soft and chewy 5 calorie  6 ounce pouch  
quality	it is the best treat ever    for appealing to humans  everyone where i work says this is the only dog treat they wish they could eat  it smells  fabulous  i mean  i have smelled a lot of dog treats  i promise you  upon opening this bag  you will go  \\ wuhhh \\  and take a deeper sniff <br  ><br  >these are not always such a sure fire hit with the dogs  however  some really go for them  it is about 60 40  the haters   the lovers  i honestly wish more dogs liked these  because they make my training pouch smell so much better than those stinky chicken   cheese nuggets i am often stuck handing out  honesty  however  compels me to admit i am often more in favor of these treats than the dogs <br  ><br  >however  i emphasize that  some  dogs did quite like these  they are a good fit for kong stuffing and puzzle toys  they are not a guarantee  but if your pup likes fruit  he will probably enjoy these 
product	the ethical pet seek a treat flip  n flap dog puzzle lasted about 10 minutes with my 2 dogs  all the flaps and doors were chewed off and pieces of press wood have been broken off in large and small shards  do not buy this product  not made for dogs 
product	my male german shepherd dog is developing more and more anxiety problems as he ages  his list now includes thunder  lightening  wind  and rain  he paces at the first hint of thunder which may still be too far off for the humans in his pack to even hear  he tries to get into the smallest possible space he can find in the house  under the television would be his first choice  but he cannot get into that six inch space  i saw the information for the thundershirt and all the positive testimonials and decided to give it a try <br  ><br  >we have had quite a few episodes of weather involving rain and wind  a few involving thunder and lightening since buying the thundershirt  if i know there is going to be a storm  or even just heavy rain i put the thundershirt on him well in advance  i also put it on him when there is absolutely no possibility of an event to trigger anxiety because i do not want him to associate the product with the anxiety causing event  putting the product on him is done in a very calm  matter of fact way without making a big deal about it  all of this is to say that i think we are doing everything right for using this product in the correct way <br  ><br  >after three months i honestly cannot see much change in my big boy  he probably does not pace quite as much  but he still heads for the smallest  tightest spot he can find to go into and yet still see his humans  he positively will not close his eyes and sleep while he has the thundershirt on so that is an unexpected development  i am going to continue to use the thundershirt during calm and stormy weather times because he shows absolutely no apprehension to wearing the product  it is super easy to put on him   but then he is normally a very calm  acquiescent dog so i never envisioned any problem getting him into the thundershirt  i would have liked for some information to be given for how to launder the product  but there is nothing included in the package  i just strapped down all the velcro portions and put it in the washer  then air dried it  that worked fine  certainly with my dog i can say that i have not seen enough improvement to warrant the price of this product <br  ><br  >   edit may 4  2012   we still put the thundershirt on siggy when we know there is the possibility of a weather \\ event\\   even something such as a simple rain  we have also continued to put it on him at random times when nothing is happening  he really does not mind wearing the product  but i honestly cannot see any improvement and he still will not sleep while he is wearing the thundershirt  what i can say is that there has not been any escalation of his anxiety symptoms  we will just have to see what happens when the tornado sirens begin to wail  i am afraid i already know the answer  but we will see <br  ><br  >    edit june 2  2012     this is the last update i will make to this review  several days ago we had a storm event which lasted almost three hours  i put the thundershirt on siggy about 30 minutes before i heard the first rumble of thunder  for the entire time he could hear the thunder he was plastered to my side trembling and panting  i suppose the small mercy is that he was not pacing  he did try to get in my lap  but a 90 pound dog and a person in one chair does not work well  he finally lay down on my feet and leaned against me  as usual he did not close his eyes during the entire time he had the thundershirt on  as soon as i took it off him he immediately fell into an exhausted sleep  i do not think this product is doing us any good at all  i will leave the star rating at 2 just because he did not pace this time  all the other anxiety indicators were present though  if i had been up and moving around  i think he would have been pacing  i have not mentioned before that one of my daughters also uses a thundershirt on one of her dogs  her results have been exactly the same as mine  not enough progress to be able to call it progress at all cro portions and put it in the washer  then air dried it  that worked fine  certainly with my dog i can say that i have not seen enough improvement to warrant the price of this product

have not mentioned before that one of my daughters also uses a thundershirt on one of her dogs  her results have been exactly the same as mine  not enough progress to be able to call it progress at all 
product	when i searched in amazon for \\ chicken jerky treats made in usa\\  this product was listed  no where in the product discription did it mention the country of origin  i purchased this product in a smaller size from a local retailer and the package said \\ made in usa\\  so i naturally assumed that the 20 ounce tub would be the same  what a surprize  when the package arrived i opened it and gave a piece to my dog  then i noticed that the label said \\ product of china\\   i cannot give this to my dog as it causes severe symptoms <br  >either amazon is misrepresenting the product as made in usa or the manufacturer is  in either case  i have learned my lesson  never buy dog treats from amazon 
product	my dog eats these with just as much gusto as she had for the non u s  jerky  but these are not really chewy  dry and crumbly  which is a problem for me  i find \\ chicken dust\\  everywhere after she is munched one of these 
quality	i supposed as a treat  this would do better than its dog food  but i was wrong when i received and tried it today  my dog does not like it at all  this treat feels like cookies and very dry  i got a small dog  yorkshire   i do not know if big dog will find it delicious or not  just my own experience 
product	packages contain small irregular pieces of freezedried meats  all our dogs will just about follow any command for them as they really enjoy them  unfortunately  lots of very small to dusty pieces in bag and fall apart in training pouch  could put dust as treat on food  but takes away real purpose  for the price  only get 3 4 a bag of usable training pieces 
quality	i have a 10 month old goldendoodle who eats everything  she spit these out and walked away  i am so disappointed  wish she loved them because the price is right   
product	i was expecting to receive these three product as shown in the seller s picture  the dry food  the cans  and the gravy pouch  i am missing urinary so dry food  and urinary so in gravy pouch  i only received 24 6 oz cans  one product out of three offered from the \\ product description\\    the cans are not really 6 oz  they are 5 8 oz  fyi  i copied and pasted the seller s product description  here it is  \\ product description royal canin veterinary diet® feline urinary so® 33 dry  urinary so® in gel can  and urinary so® in gravy pouch   \\  the missing two products   where are they  misleading indeed  shop for different seller    asin b0039okm8o royal canin feline urinary so cat food 24 6 oz cans   it does not deserve a star  even 
quality	the first bonita flakes i bought my cats were the cat man do brand  my two cats are pretty picky but loved the flakes  i bought this brand next because it was cheaper but the cats will not eat it  i had large long flakes of this brand out and put the very last crumbs of the other kind down next to them and my cats both tried to lick up the crumbs and ignored this brand <br  ><br  >i compared the ingredients of the two brands  and the only difference is that cittikitty contains ash  whatever that means  it was a deal breaker for my cats <br  ><br  >also  if you have a japanese or asian grocery store in town  you can purchase katsuobushi  which is pure bonita flakes meant for human consumption  so a better quality  and they are much cheaper 
quality	this food may be good for my cats  but two of my ragdolls  and these are large cats  will not eat the chunks because they are so large 
product	my 18 lb   18 month old puppy destroyed this item within half an hour  i was very disappointed and felt that it was a waste of money 
quality	all cats are different but i tried giving this to 6 different cats  only one showed the slightest interest  she licked it a couple of times and walked away  the other 5 showed no interest at all and they all love regular catnip  it is very hard maybe that was the problem  i would not suggest these to anyone 
health	i got these because another reviewer claimed they were softer and did not have the dreaded string membrane in them  unfortunately  these are quite hard  very sharp jagged edges  and do indeed have the string that dogs can choke on  my wife wants to return them  but i do not like to deal with shipping  i tried soaking them in hot water  breaking them up into smaller pieces  etc  nothing really helps  my dogs like these a lot  but they are going to break their teeth  choke  or have their mouth stomach be cut by them  i believe this product should be taken off the market <br  ><br  >also  since they are so sharp  and since they were packaged tightly in the box they came in  i purchased two packs of these and two bully stick packs at the same time   the product actually pokes small holes into the plastic package it came in  these holes will make the product become stale and old much faster  perhaps it is why they are so hard to begin with <br  ><br  >do not buy this product    it is no better or different than their competitors that are making the same dangerous product 
product	all of the cases that were delivered had been damaged  the cans of cat food were dented and there were 4 cans that had split open at the top   won t order cat food like this again 
product	i take full responsibility for not paying attention but assumed that like so many other things i order  this would be a double or triple pack of mini bones  believe it or not  i have over  8 in one box  our dog will eat these slowly  a real rip off  pay attention folks 
product	i ordered this flavor of ff because i knew how much my two cats like it  i received ff sliced turkey in gravy  a totally different thing than the grilled turkey  i have a 21yo cat and a cat with stomatitis  very painful mouth at times with difficulty eating  the chunks are huge in the product they sent me so only the gravy gets eaten  a total waste of money  if it had been the right product i could have rated it highly from previous experiences  because i thought it was a one  time mistake  i reordered the right stuff with my prime and then s s to save money  i got the same wrong ff twice more  as before so i have cancelled my s s  amazon was great  they refunded my purchases  but they could not guarantee the right product being delivered  so of course  i will never order this again  it is too bad  it is a great deal and my cats love the grilled turkey in gravy  sometimes it just does not work out  but thank you amazon for helping me out  and making it as right as you could 
product	i have been trying to find treats that have no sugar  are low in fat and made in usa for my diabetic yorkie poo  thought i would found them  search amazon with made in usa dog treats and see this product appear on the list  go to smokehouse s website and red that only some of their chicken products have product of china on the label  so by omission i think  ok it is duck  not chicken so it is made in usa  i order them  my dog loves them  i come back to amazon to buy more and notice something i missed the first time  someone has written a review saying they are made in china  i check my package and sure enough  it days product of china  i do not know who to be more angry with  amazon for listing it as usa when i search  smokehouse for misleading me on their website  or me for not reading the label after it got here 
health	well  both my abbysinian and domestic shorthair devour this and the florentine brands  however  i am slightly haunted by one vet telling me it is like feeding your kids mcdonalds everyday  the best retort  scratch on wood  is that i have been blessed  they are both near 9 years of age  with thankfully no history of health issues  so when martin spurley did the documentary that had him eat mcdonalds for a month  he was quite ill and putrid looking after the month ended        thankfully both of my cats are healthy  happy and well adjusted babies 
quality	what a waste of money  all four cats  three indoor and one feral outdoor cat  will not eat the wet food  they like the juice and will lick that up  but they leave the meaty bits behind  i tried each flavor and not one cat will eat this stuff  i was hoping to save some money with friskies  but it is what it is  and what it is is food that a hungry wild cat will not eat  she would rather catch and eat mice   \ my suggestion is to go to the store and buy a couple different cans and try that out first  if your cat does not eat it  it will save you from having 2 dozen paper weights 
health	posted nov 11  2011 on the fda website  \\ the food and drug administration  fda  is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs  also sold as chicken tenders  strips or treats  may be associated with illness in dogs \\  at the bottom of the bag of these dogswell products  in very small letters  it says \\ made in china\\   after feeding these to my dogs  one become violently ill  another died of cancer   maybe related  maybe not  why take the chance   
product	i bought these for my sweet little brussels griffon who absolutely loved the nice  big  still flexible wagoneer chicken sticks  but they were made in china  and i was not going to risk her getting ill from the made in china chicken sticks any longer  these are smaller  and not nearly as moist as the other brand  but they are from the usa and she likes them fine  they are hard and crumbly and i know i would not want to eat them if i were in her place  but  i am willing to accept this for now because i do not want to risk her health unneccesarily  and because  personally  i am really tired of all the iffy products that seem to be coming from china these days 
product	i was looking to avoid all the \\ made in china\\  dog treats  so thought i would try these out  the ingredients list is simple   chicken and natural smoke flavor  however  the jerky is very dry and hard brittle   it sounds like she is eating the chicken bones instead of the meat  she was a little hesitant at first   which has never been an issue with the vitality  made in china  treats   but once she got started she seemed to enjoy it  so maybe she likes the crunch  my biggest concern would be that splinters will be formed while she is eating that could cause injury  i think my search for a made in the usa chicken jerky treat will continue 
product	i decided to try a different brand of beefy sticks because the cost was a little less  although my dogs love these just like the \\ other\\  brands  the width of these is barely pencil size and does not save me any     very disappointing  i will be sticking with the \\ other\\  brand on amazon  the are stickered made in the u s a  so i am not sure what the review stating they were made in china is about   also  the package is labeled pizzle stix  not beefy sticks 
product	i thought i was receiving the sage color canister  but was surprised when i opened the box and saw the cream color  even more surprised that the canister had a scratch on it that had removed the paint  right in the front under \\ good dog\\   the container is cheap feeling and not worth the  12  buyers beware 
product	i ordered the milk bone soft chicken bones after doing a cost comparison between what the local store price and the price of the product shown on amazon  the picture on amazon showed a larger ounce package than the 25 oz package i received  i wrote a compliant and was told that the product was not at fault but rather how amazon displayed it  i felt fooled 
health	we were looking for a 100  meat treat for our dog  sourced and also made in the usa  this particular smokehouse usa treat fit the bill  though others under the same label do not   initially  we were excited that our dog seemed to love the taste of these treats  she ate the two strips we gave her with gusto   especially since she is very picky about most \\ healthy\\  stuff for dogs <br  ><br  >however  not long after ingesting these  she became violently ill with gastrointestinal symptoms continuing for days  non stop diarrhea was the worst part of it  aside from these treats  nothing else in her diet was different than usual  her appetite is still not back to normal  and it is been a month now  she is listless and just does not seem like herself yet  though the gi issues are ok now <br  ><br  >i wanted to warn people that these treats are irradiated  since the listing here on amazon does not indicate it  there is a seal on the back of the package stating  \\ treated with radiation for your safety\\   since a number of foods are irradiated for human and pet consumption and thought to be safe  i am not sure if unsafe levels of radiation was the issue in our case  or if it was simple food poisoning <br  ><br  >either way  i wish i would known the treats were irradiated before i bought them  especially since the irradiated orijen cat food imported to australia in 2008 ended up being the cause of death and illness for many cats  it is getting harder and harder to stay healthy in this world  but being forewarned of potential issues is better than lack of awareness at all  and i will not be buying more smokehouse usa products  regardless of what the source of our issue was <br  ><br  > see article re  feline deaths illnesses from orijen cat food irradiated at entry into australia  2008   here      
product	  asin b001cpupma smokehouse usa 100  natural chicken breast strips dog treats  16 ounce resealable bag  this product was listed as made in usa  it is made in china  ingredients are not reliable unless made in usa  do not be mislead as i was 
product	my dog figured this out really fast and likes it a lot  however  it is over priced since my dog can get to the treats fast and he is a fast eater  i would suggest investing in a treat ball instead  that ll keep there attention longer and they are similarly priced 
product	my ten pound yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games   if there is not food  he is not playing  we have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him  the yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders  for a dog that loves any game that involves food  this just proved much too frustrating for him  and believe me  we tried to help our little guy out with this  we left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel  but even that was too difficult for him to \\ spin\\  as it did not move easily  and it is not like our dog is not \\ paw centric\\  as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his kong  and to fish treats out from under furniture  etc  we tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy  but all parties finally agreed that this just was not fun the way a toy should be  perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you  but it received two paws down from our little buddy <br  ><br  >one other concern that i had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw  granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended  but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product   yes i am a worry wart pet parent  but you would be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into    
health	this listing if for the high fiber version of the gastrointestinal food formula  it is not what i had intended to purchase  i am trying it for my cat anyway  since it states it will still help with diarrhea  but am more impressed with reviews for the he formula on other sites  wish me luck that this works 
product	boo amazon  i thought i loved you for the convenience you offer and the reasonable pricing  but when you raise the price of a recurring item  40   in two month s time  i feel like you are scamming me  the first month i paid about  13  the next month about  15  ok  fine  demand goes up  i get it  next month   21   and you do not even give me special notice  and this item costs  0 49 can or  15 68 per 32 in any major grocery store on sale  feels like you are preying on the busy  confused  or unaware  bottom line  sign up for subscribe   save  dear shopper  but keep your eyes on the price 
quality	i ordered beef but got chicken flavor  since i do not want to return it for an exchange  i gave it a try hoping that my kitty loves it  she  however  turned her nose up and look at me as if saying \\ what s wrong  where is the beef \\ 
health	i was hoping this would be as good as the beef   chicken pill pockets but these were dry and rubbery  i had a hard time getting the pocket to stay wrapped around the pill  and it really smells   not too good   although my dog does not seem to be turned off by that   of course with most dogs   the smellier the better      she does appear to like the taste   just wish it was not as rubbery as these seem to be  maybe it is because of it being `allergy formula  and does not contain the stuff that keeps it from being dry  the number of ingredients is a lot less than the beef pockets    
health	i will continue to give these to my dogs  they like them and supposedly they clean their teeth <br  >i started to give these to my dog daily  but her digestive system did not like it enough for that  most of it seems to be digestible  but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one a day greenies  note that she was also constipated as well  greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these  so i am guess they know these side effects can occur  my dog has plenty of water available  but she did not drink any more than normal  which may have resulted in the effects  i do not plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these  giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects  and that what i plan on doing <br  >not a complaint to me  but i think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from \\ green \\  it is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin  it is also made from concentrated grain protein  rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting  i personally do not feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12 18 years  but or people who invest the extra money on organic natural dog food  you should be staying away from this product 
product	this is not as advertised  i received a non clumping cat litter just like the some of the other reviews  do not buy    
health	the cats  who will not eat people food   not even salmon or chicken  were not about to eat these as \\ treats\\   they are kibble born and bred  but   when i crumbled them up in my fingers and sprinkled the bits on their kibbles  most of the treat was consumed and no nasty looks from the cats  they have gotten used to it and i put one on the food every other day or so  no barfed up hairballs to report since   these are domestic shorthairs with one being a little more fuzzy than the other  so i cannot say the cats loved it and ate them right up but the product has apparently diminished the hair in the tummy issue enough to stop the barfage 
product	was impressed at first with this  did not show damage at all for the first little while  has now been 3 1 2 months and she   black lab  has been able to take chunks of the plastic off  kong extreme is far better than this product  but  never know til you try   
quality	both my dogs hate these things for some reason  makes me angry that i bought these and they will not even touch them  they smell good tho 
health	i am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in china  treats from china have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs  another series of dog deaths from treats from china has been released  there is no oversight  these treats may be ok but i will not take any chances  i am really irritated with amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product  they say in the online description  \\ read the label carefully\\   in very small print the country of origin is disclosed  i do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from china <br  ><br  >these are great treat  my dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers  however  at most other on line pet websites they are half the price  usually amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products 
product	i use advantage blue on my 3 cats  it kills nothing  i ordered it from ok pets and it took a month to get to me in florida  i applied it to the area between the shoulder blades   thet was on this past thursday  my blonde cat just jumped up on my desk and you could see at least a half dozen fleas on his face under the hair  none of the cats stopped licking and chewing for even a day  i will have to capstar them to get them relief  i have a newly remodeled home with tons of carpet  i will probably need an exterminator too  soooo frustrating  i do not get why these big companies like bayer cannot stay on top of these things 
health	found out afterward that the fda has issued a warning on chicken jerky products made in china  over 200 dogs have become sick or died due to poisoning  the warning has been out since 2007 but apparently  the fda does not force a recall when it is only affecting dogs  we threw them away 
health	both my cats like it but after 6 months i see no weight loss in my overweight cat  they are healthy and happy but still not where they should be weightwise 
quality	i appreciate the ingredient list in these checkups  with no wheat  gluten  or corn  no added sugar  we have 2 shetland sheepdogs  and one of my shelties has epilepsy and it seems gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers so we avoid those ingredients <br  ><br  >zoey  28 lbs    bailey  21 lbs  would each get one checkup once or twice a week  and did not have any problems with throwing these up or getting runny poo  but they would eat them by breaking off a piece with their molars  which was easy for them to do   then work the piece around in their mouth to soften and chew it  and swallow  gone in less than 10 minutes  even for zoey who is a \\ lady like\\  eater and thoroughly chews everything  never gulping  the problem spot on my shelties  teeth is their canine teeth  they get plaque buildup near the gumline  these checkups do not do a thing for front teeth because my dogs only use their molars to  briefly  chew them <br  ><br  >my vet recommended instead to get raw  not cooked   beef knuckle bones or marrow bones  because the shape and size of those encourage the dog to use their front teeth to get in there and pull and pluck at the meat and marrow  in addition to using their molars to scrape off meat  the raw bones do not splinter and are soft enough that they will not crack my dogs  teeth   fyi  after trying both knuckle and marrow bones  my shelties get more chewing with knuckle bones and they each get to chew on the knuckle bone for an hour every other day on a mat in the garage    chewing makes them happy and tired  and my vet is very happy with their teeth   my vet said for teeth cleaning we need scraping action  and these checkups do not provide it  nor do any of those \\ dental rawhides\\  you see in stores <br  ><br  >these checkups are a nice little quick treat for my small medium size shelties  but not for teeth cleaning  5 stars for the good ingredient list  but 1 star for teeth cleaning action    average of 3 stars  perhaps if you have a tiny little dog and the idea of raw knuckle bones grosses you out  these checkups might be a good option  but i will not buy these again as they are just not what i need <br  ><br  >checkups ingredients  from the checkups website  <br  >potato flour  rice flour  glycerine  water  natural flavor  gelatin  canola oil  titanium dioxide  monoglycerides of edible fatty acids  flaxseed oil  citric acid  magnesium stearate  tetrasodium pyrophosphateckle bones grosses you out  these checkups might be a good option  but i will not buy these again as they are just not what i need  checkups ingredients  from the checkups website   potato flour  rice flour  glycerine  water  natural flavor  gelatin  canola oil  titanium dioxide  monoglycerides of edible fatty acids  flaxseed oil  citric acid  magnesium stearate  tetrasodium pyrophosphate
product	very sugary smelling  but my african grey is sampling and eating it more each day  i break each piece in half for him  mixing in his zupreem pellet with it  this huge bag will last a long time  i warn you not to be low on your bird s food because it took a week over the promised delivery time  i was not happy with the shipping time at all  that is what the 3 stars is for because i did not get a link to leave seller feedback  ordered on the 8th and delivered on the 23rd  way way too long for shipping <br  ><br  >this is an update to my previous observations and comments  it has been 9 months and it is time to reorder so i will not run out and expect the shipping to take extra long <br  ><br  >my congo loves the stuff and it is economical to buy this size  he get supplemented with raw fruit and veggies  food bit are easy for him to hold and if he drops them it is an easy pick up  provided it is falling on a clean cage botton  so i am reordering from the same seller  we will see how quickly the next one arrives <br  ><br  >second order update  shipping was quicker by ozbo this time  the bag had a hole inside area by top  did not notice it while unpacking  i should have returned it for replacement  my lazy bad  it seemed lighter in weight  confirmed it was by several oz  i am feeding it to grey  he still likes it smaller and i will not order this nutblend again for that reason 
health	i agree with some of the other reviewers  this is not the original product  the color and smell is different  while my dog likes them  she became very sick after eating a couple of them and was a mess to clean up  she had eaten the original product for the past year with no problems  i will be seeking a refund as this is not the product i was expecting  beware this product has changed 
quality	amazon should not even carry this   even the neighborhood strays would not eat it  i feed it to the fish in our neighborhood pond  they like it 
product	the seed i ordered was pictured as hartz \\ select    diet for parrots\\   green and orange parrot on wrapper  i have used this seed mixture for my conures for the past two years and like it very much  because my conures like it   the product i got was hartz   \\ bird diet for large birds    amazons  african greys  cockatoos etc\\    the wrapper features a white cockatiel  the mixtures in the two products are almost totally different  the one i received is full of very large  hard \\ fake peanuts\\     which my little conures cannot hold or eat  i am trying to use the food since i did not want to pay to shipit back  but am throwing away much of it  i will not order again from you 
product	little disappointed at first when received and my sheltie sort of went nose up on them and i thought they where soup crackers  but he started liking them and there certainly are enough of them in bag  think they would be good for dog training where you just need something little for repetitive positive reinforcment  i am not sure of the taste but he is liking them more and more 
quality	my yellow lab  who loves any and all food  does not like these  i get them out and she does not come running  so that is the perfect indication  i pull out some other snacks to lure her into her crate and she bounds in   but not with these 
product	i ordered these  along with another product that supposedly contained glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate  i received substitute products  of lesser quantity and quality  for this price  unfortunately  i just noticed this so cannot return  very disappointed with quality control shipping 
quality	wish the fact these are irradiated was in the header for these \\ treats\\   if you would not eat irradiated food  why give it to your dog  there are plenty of dog snacks out there that are all natural and not irradiated  by the way  anyone want a few bags of these  i will give you a discount 
product	these are ridiculously tiny  between 1 1 2 ~ 2 inches    definitely not worth the  4 16 i paid for them  save your hard earned money  fellow amazon ians 
quality	my dog refused to eat any of these  i had to give them away  beware if your dog is picky 
quality	i have two diabetic cats and this is one of their favorite flavors the price here on amazon was very good and i thought it would be nice and convenient to have it shipped to my home <br  ><br  >i received the case quickly and it was packed well however when i opened the first can i noticed that the \\ meat\\  was much darker than the cans i purchase locally  my cats would not eat any of the amazon cans i purchased some locally to check to see if perhaps my cats had tired of this flavor  they quickly devoured the local cans  the dates were good on the amazon cans so that was not the issue <br  ><br  >anyhow  i am going to cancel my subscription for this product 
product	i have been getting these chips for my dogs for a long time  i have noticed lately that the chips are thicker and therefore the weight of the box is more so for a 9 oz box i may only get 6 or 7 chips and i have 4 dogs  they get one at bedtime every night so this can get expensive  the dogs also prefer the thinner chips  i have four yorkies 
product	i am not sure what all the rave reviews are about  my small dog does not really like them  and she is not exactly a picky eater  i gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because she will eat it  but she always seems a little unsure of whether she wants it or not  and that is weird  she would prefer a bite of a real apple to these any day 
health	i have two male cats that normally love to eat  one of which has a re occurring ut problem  i purchased this food because i was running out of money paying  56 for a 16 lb bag of royal canin prescription hard food and  40 for a 24 pack of prescription canned soft food  the only problem is that neither one of my cats will touch this stuff  they will not touch the pro plan urinary tract health formula either  now that they eat higher quality food than their owner  they must feel that this food is not up to the standards that the prescription food is  they also now will not eat the science diet that they loved to eat exclusively for 4 years  when it comes down to it  i am sure that this food is probably great  just be aware that picky eaters may starve themselves if you lay a bowl of this food in front of them after letting them get accustomed the fancy stuff  after laying out two heaping bowls of this stuff  there was a two day hunger strike that ended when i caved in and gave them some more prescription food  since that is the only food that they will eat anymore 
health	this product did seem to help our flea infestation somewhat but ultimately  we needed to have a professional service treat our house and yard and are using this product to maintain it 
health	i started ordering these cases a few months ago and had to cancel after my cats threw up on two different occasions after eating this food    one of my cats never ever throws up and threw up from this   and the only two cats who threw up were the ones who ate this  so i am 99  sure it was from the food  since it happened again a couple of weeks later  i decided i better stop ordering this food  sure enough  no throwing up anymore 
health	we are fairly recent fans of the evo line of cat treats <br  >we used to give our cats temptations for quite a long time  but after<br  >waking up and reading the back of the bag  we realized it was just junk food for cats <br  >and we were probably doing them more harm than good with those treats   they also have<br  >some kind of \\ kitty msg\\  in them  because the cats literally would eat the whole bag if we had let them  <br  ><br  >evo has done a good job of getting rid of corn and wheat  two big allergens for cats <br  >cats do not eat grains naturally  so the companies who use it are just packing in filler products <br  ><br  >our cats have loved the evo treats  but i have to say that the herring salmon was a bomb <br  >they are not nearly as big on these as the other two kinds  they kind of smell  which would not always<br  >be a bad thing   but apparently it is not a great smell to cats either  both of our cats will catch treats <br  >chase them down if thrown  etc etc  but this flavor sits on the floor until it apparently has aired out  or<br  >the cat feel faint from lack of snackage  then our older cat will come by and eat them  most likely just out<br  >of spite to be sure the younger cat does not get them <br  ><br  >i will not be buying this flavor again  however  if your cat is a fish flavor fan  likes wet food in fishy<br  >flavors  or other dry fish flavored treats   they might like this one <br  >i ve not seen any gastric upset from any of the evo flavors  so they are apparently digested well too <br  ><br  >evo  maybe you can make a mouse flavored treat  or a ham flavored one <br  >both of our cats adore cooked ham  but you never see ham treats for cats <br  >yes  i understand about the worm issues  but cooking to proper temperatures takes care of that <br  >there is also the odd virus from swine  but that has been eradicated in the usa  so the odds of<br  >domestic cats getting anything from pork is slim to none 
product	i ordered this thinking that my cats would love to play with it  they like to make issues when they are playing because they like to solve the issues  ie they put a fake mouse in a shoe a to make it harder to play with or something else to make it harder to play with  i figured that they needed a toy that made them think and saw this  it was cheap and simple so i thought it would work  when i got the ball my first reaction was  it is too big for my cats  and my cats are big  one is 13 lbs  and the other is 16 lbs  sure my cats could hit the ball if they wanted too but i do not see why they would want to  the ball size is the size of a baseball  so it is big compared to normal cat balls which are about the size of a gold ball  although i do not see my cats using it i am going to give it to a friend who has a dog and see if it will work for them  i gave this 2 stars because although it would not work for a cat i think it would be good for a dog  also it looks as though it is been made really well  it is a thick hard plastic 
quality	do not give this to your pet  it is awful  it is toxic  i gave this to my dog charlie and he was just not himself for 2 3 months  we could not understand him or what was up  after some time  obviously  and thinking and eliminating what it was that we or he did differently in that time span  it was this product  we switched from frontline to this for the mosquito feature and other improvements  so we thought  <br  ><br  >he started acting differently  not eating as much  was lethargic and mopy sad     he was not him  so  i started researching  at first i found information on the internet  some reliable sites  some not as     and i took it all in  let some time sink in  thought it over  then i did more research  found the same sites  some newer sites  and after some time was convinced and still am that it was this product <br  ><br  >after a month or more passed by   enough time to get it out of his system  as the product then requires monthly dosing   he began to act normal  get better  after one month he was better  and after 2 months  i said to my wife  \\ yes  chuck is back \\  he was running around here like crazy  getting pumped up when we returned home  playing with all his toys  eating    <br  ><br  >i hate this product and i am very angry with my vet who is not aware that there are situations out there regarding this product  perhaps she and others are not aware  but people need to be aware  true or not   to have something like that floating around about your product is just not good  move on to something else  just look and read some of the awful stories     do you even want to chance that with your pet    i would never   and even if you are skeptical  again  do you even want to potentially risk it  in the event that it is true  i believe it to be as i witnessed my dog s health and well being at a minimum during this product s administering  
product	the food itself is great  my cat loves the variety and it is a great deal  however  i am subscribed to this product for a shipment every few months and without fail each shipment has arrived very bashed up  the outside box will be fine but then a few of the cans will be smashed in  one case even came with dripping cat food liquid on it  yuck  i wrote a message to packaging for amazon and received no assistance or changes  product gets 2 stars because of the food itself  amazon gets 0 stars for the way they handle pack ship this product 
quality	got this for a cat we were fostering who had problems with her teeth and could not eat dry food  she also would not eat the higher end canned food  even though she liked this  we switched to fancy feast  which she also liked and appears to have better ingredients 
product	i ordered this when it was on sale at about  9  shipping  it was supposed to be a 6 pack of 3oz packages  but i only got one 3oz  which retails at  2 50 each   i called the seller to complain and they were quick to offer a refund  but they did not send me 5 additional packages because they claimed that there was a mistake on amazon about the amount sold  my cat loves the greenies themselves  she would eat just greenies all the time if i let her  she is a 12 year old and she only started eating them 1 year ago  but the vets say she has great teeth for her age  i will repurchase greenies  but not from entirelypets 
health	my cats like fancy feast no doubt and i got a good price on this product  however  the down side    the cats are not crazy about this flavor and one of them throws up from it and they do not throw up from any other foods  i put it side by side with the fancy feast poultry and they gobble that up with no getting sick  for whatever reason the filet mignon flavor is just not a hit with them and it is also from my perspective in comparison to other selections it does not smell good either <br  ><br  >i am only giving two stars over one because i do tend to like the fancy feast name and so do my cats  another cat might like this flavor just fine but my crew does not 
quality	do not  do not order this product  friskies senior diet pacific salmon dinner in sauce  you will not get what you ordered  they send you regular salmon  which my son opened up making it unable to return  i now have 24 cans of salmon which my two cats will not eat  it was a rip off and had i been able to return the product i most surely would have  my cats will not eat it and i had to eat 12 bucks 
product	bought from dig it pet products  the best by date had been rubbed off  so no way to tell if it is fresh  older packaging with the word  feline  under the word  pockets  rather than above the word  greenies   opened the package today 1 7 12   they were all stale 
product	please be aware that this order is for the 4 oz bag  not the 12 oz bag  for this price i made the mistake of assuming it was the 12 oz bag since a quick glance did not reveal the size  but this is a total rip off  do not pay this price for a small bag  look for other vendors that sell the same product for much less 
health	after buying a few merrick 12\\  bones from the local pet store for  8 10 a piece  we figured it was time we buy in bulk to help our 6 month old puppy out <br  ><br  >she s been eating bully sticks for about 2 3 months now as she absolutely loves them  and it keeps her quiet calm  it also helps her teethe <br  ><br  >we ordered a 25 pack of these 12\\  sticks  she peels these sticks  she is a 16 lb beagle puppy  she does not chew them from a given side  she tries to peel them like stringy cheese <br  ><br  >bully sticks in general will give a dog gas  while not too big of a problem  it will still upset their stomach enough   where in her case   she has thrown up  and does not run to her food bowl anymore  today she stopped eating anything and not a sip of water <br  ><br  >the doctor gave her an xray and says there is no blockage  but it is most likely gas causing her discomfort for food and water <br  ><br  >for now  she will no longer have bully sticks to eat  merrick brand or not  it may just be a puppy thing  as their stomachs are sensitive when young  but it appears the amazon com batch of merrick bones has caused her these types of dangerous reactions  she eats one 12\\  over a course of 2 days  it normally would get to about 5 6\\  in size when we would take it away and give her a new one <br  ><br  >good luck if it works for you  just watch your puppy s change of habits and be careful <br  >reuben
quality	we fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day  some of the toys he loved  but he just did not really understand this one  he was a puppy  so it could have just been that his brain needed more time to grow  or maybe he just had other toys he liked more  i think it is a great idea  i would suggest getting some really fragrant treats  because there is a lot of room between where the treats are stored and the hole that they come out of  we tried it with dog food and he was not interested  also  the plastic is a bit hard  so just be cautious if you have wood floors  we did not have issues with ours  but it is nice to know  we gave the toys to the dog shelter when our foster dog was adopted  so i cannot speak to how other dogs enjoyed it 
product	i was so hoping this stuff would work  our best guess as to what our dog is an australian shepherd border collie mix  and he sheds like crazy  plus it is the super fine hair that even vacuuming everyday does not get rid off  it was a minor nuisance  but then we had a baby and i cannot stand all the baby stuff covered in dog hair every time it touches the floor  she has not even started crawling yet  when she does i am sure it will drive me even more nuts  so that is what drove me to fork out the money to try this shedx  i used it as directed for three months  hoping hoping hoping  but no improvement  i used it for the first six weeks as another reviewer said it took that long to work  then i took him to get groomed and brushed to get all the old loose hair  thinking that maybe that was why it was not working  then the shedding improved slightly and i hoped it was the shed x and not just the brushing  but within a couple weeks we were back to square one  i kept using it for another month to use up what i had bought  still hoping  but i am now done with my fourth bottle and still have hair everywhere  this product did not do anything for shedding  and it did not really do anything for his coat  since i already give him fish oil capsules daily  the only good thing i can say about this stuff is my dog loved the taste  but he loves his fish oil capsules just as much  and they are significantly cheaper and easier than this stuff  the bottles this stuff comes in are a joke  they leak everywhere and make a huge greasy mess  i would not recommend this to anyone 
quality	my ferret was not interested in this whatsoever  other reviewers said their ferrets loved it and that is why i bought it  he has not even eaten a single piece of it 
product	although the description claims these to be 8 9 inches they are considerably smaller in girth and length than 7 8 inch rawhide bones i get at costco  a little disappointing    on the other hand my golden loves them  so i am not completely unhappy 
product	i used to swear by advantage and advantage ii  but the last few times i have applied it  it has not been working as well as it used to  october s dose barely worked at all  not only that  but it actually left a dyed section on 2 of my cats  necks  it was definitely a bad batch  somehow diluted perhaps    and it will be a long time before i use advantage again  i have about 10 cats total  indoor and out  i use this product on  with different weights  it did not work on any of them well this time at all  back to frontline 
product	their product came with the seal broken but in a way that you may not notice  the weight for the dog is in kg  u s product list in pounds  it may be a non u s  product  the packaging looked old beaten up  i would pay a lot more to avoid this source of frontline  your dog is relying on you to be treated with a doubt free product 
product	the title of this product is very misleading  be sure to read all the text in all descriptions  you are only going to receive 1 package of cat food  unlike the misleading title which claims it to be a six pack  very deceptive practice there in my opinion 
product	neither our toy poodle or the australian shepherd will eat these  they smell like a vitamin  they are also brown  the expiration date says 12 2013  i think they expired long ago  the whole room smells when you open the box  i requested a refund 
product	my dogs love them   they are pricey for a treat tho <br  >i did not notice any change on their teeth  plaque stayed the same   even tho i gave it to my dog 2 times a day for few months  still needed to go to the vet for deep teeth cleaning 
quality	we have a small dog  17 lbs  and she could not get started on these   they were too hard to bite  once we cut them in half  which is quite hard to do   she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them  we probably would not buy them again  since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time  and it did not really work for that  either she could not eat it at all  or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half 
health	unfortunately  these made my dogs sick and they threw up green all over our beige carpet  cannot get the stain out   was really hopeful they would be helpful to our dogs dental needs  maybe they work well for other dogs   but definitely not mine 
quality	i bought these treats as well as the halo daily food thinking that i would give my 4 year old cats something a bit healthier for them  trouble insued at the food dish  neither cat will eat these treats or the bagged food  it could be the odor  not too appetizing or the size  very small pellets  whatever it was  they would not eat it and i am back to purina one 
health	and by haunt you  i mean in the form of vomit all over the place  though my dog  a 150lb  newfoundland  absolutely loved the bone but even after just a few minutes chewing it  he had managed to gnaw off some bone slivers and swallowed them  shortly after that he was throwing up  not just the bone slivers  but everything he had eaten for what seemed like days  so  while it seemed great to give him a treat that he loved so thoroughly  the aftermath just was not worth it 
health	carnivore kisses by stella and chewy s link    asin b002jfzlz8 stella   chewy s carnivore kisses  freeze dried chicken breast dog treats   inside the pieces  \\ kisses\\   are the tendons or ligaments  my best guess from the chicken breast that are still attached  you cannot see them because they are within the kiss  these are chunks that are not ground up like their terrific bags of \\ freeze dried safe raw food\\   when i broke the kisses apart for my 5 lb dog  there were pieces of these tendons ligaments that were hard  some long and one of them actually sharp  i believe it could have easily pierced or choked my dog  if you break them apart  it will be fine  but under no circumstances  in my opinion  should these be fed to a smaller dog who could suffer some severe consequences from the contents of these \\ kisses\\  
product	my bird refused to have anything to do with this \\ treat\\   i think that this product might be more suited for a larger parrot  i was very disappointed 
quality	i thought this item was a great idea  unfortunately my two cats did not not agree  system worked great but my cats do not like seeing or smelling their own poop  regular cat litter masks the odors pretty good but this system does not  poop sits in full view which my older cat disliked very much  so much that she started doing her business on the floor next to the litter box  back to using the rolling litter box that i have been using for the past five years  cats love it 
quality	i bought these for my son s gerbils because they were chewing up their cage  their wheel  igloo  etc  these are quite hard and they do not really chew on them  they have nibbled the ends of 1 stick a bit  but that is all  i think these would be better for a larger animal  perhaps a guinea pig or rabbit  but  i think they are too hard for smaller rodents  i ordered them a softer \\ log \\  which they love 
product	this is not for heavy chewers  but we liked it so much that every time zoe would chew through one  we would buy another  we would put her food in it and while it dispensed slowly  it gave us time to get other things done  as she ate  now the hole is larger  so her food just falls out  we are greatly disappointed and trying other products now   asin b0041kogfu omega paw ttlg6 tricky treat ball  large  
quality	i have two cats that like to chew on cardboard  paper  wood  pens  pencils   but will not touch these at all  i tried to microwave them and bend them so cats could reach better but they still had no interest at all  i thought these were an awesome idea but sadly  not for my cats 
health	i got these for a 3 month old 4 lb havanese puppy because her breeder had given us one  i thought  that has lasted a couple of weeks  i just gave her the puppy chew and i was shocked when she had a 1 inch piece in her mouth  which i quickly took away as a choking hazard  in less than 10 minutes  i now believe what the breeder had given me was something else that looks just like these puppy chews  maybe it was an edible dog chew  this chew is not long lasting by any stretch of the imagination  i should add that my puppy really enjoyed it for the 10 minutes 
health	the price was great but my dog vomitted every time he ate a can  he seemed to eat it well but we were cleaning up after him after each meal  he stopped as soon as we changed his food 
quality	first  let me say that my cat loves these appetizers  and she gets one every night as a treat  for that  i would give this product 5 stars  however  the entire experience including value for my money and such drops this to 2 stars because of the change in packaging  change in number of trays sent and no change in price  first shipment contained 12 trays as it was expected to  however  the second shipment was a different packaging box and only contained 10 trays  what the heck    maybe that does not seem like a big difference to you  but the price did not change with the change in the number of trays  i do not like getting ripped off  intentionally or not 
product	i still have not received my order  it has been almost a month  is it still gona come or can i get a refund now 
health	beware if your cocker is allergic to wheat or corn  this food is full of grains that are known to cause allergies in dogs  i bought this for my niece s cocker spaniel who has skin allergies  initially there was no problem and not only did the dog love the food  but so did the 3 cats in the household  within a couple weeks  however  the dogs allergies were back with a vengeance  i believe rc just makes the food tasty to animals  but the nutrition is questionable  i have tried royal canin cat food for my cat and she had the worst gas imaginable  switched her to wellness and the problem cleared up  note the ingredients are not listed here on amazon  look elsewhere for that on sites like dogfoodadvisor com and you will find that royal canin foods in general do not get good grades  there is much better food on the market for about the same price  wellness  blue wilderness taste of the wild to mention a few  it is a great idea to develop breed specific food  but in the case of royal canin i believe it is nothing more than a marketing ploy 
health	i have purchased these snacks in a plastic jar in the past  could only get them in iowa and could not find them locally so i was happy when i saw these on the internet  wrong   the snacks are so stale and hard that i am afraid to give them to my dog  he will either break a tooth or choke  vendor seems to be selling an old product 
health	looked like these would be great when they first arrived  the pieces are large  and my pup enjoyed chewing away at them  however  my pup has a sensitive stomach and these treats give him loose stools whenever he eats them  i would not recommend for dogs with sensitive stomachs  stick with flossies 
product	i buy treats for my dogs in bulk to have them on hand  i opened this package 2 months after purchase  which meant it is too late to return  and found the product to be moldy  this is even though the expiration date has not been reached yet  also  the sweet potatoes are soft  as if they are not fully dehydrated  i have bought this product at local stores and have not had a problem  this must be part of a bad batch  i will not be buying this product or other dog treats from amazon again  as now i am out of the money i paid 
product	  asin b000q5km0c advantage once a month topical flea treatment for cats   kittens up to 9 lbs  6 applications   do not waste your money on this flea treatment  i used it on my two cats as directed  and it was useless  the flea medication is expensive and i bought it with the expectation that it would help with fleas  it has not and i will never purchase it again
health	do not buy this our kitties have vomited this all over the house  does not agree with them  terrible product i do not recommend 
product	my cats enjoy this food  and it is of good quality  however  now that i am a regular subscriber i have found that someone is being very careless in packaging and delivery  my last order arrived in a box that was too big  poorly packed  and half opened at my door  when i looked inside  i found several cans had exploded and many more were all dented and loose inside the box  what a mess  so  after a long day at work  i found myself rinsing and inspecting cans of cat food  the price has gone up also  and at this point i am thinking it would be less trouble to buy from the pet store again  at least i will not end up with a mess at my door 
product	my dog enjoys these treats  but they do not last  the very first time he got an everlasting treat it took him a couple of days to gnaw and lick the rounded treats out of the ball holder  ever since though  he has figured out how to get the treats out of the ball quickly  then chews them up like biscuits  thought the interlocking screw on idea might keep the treats in the ball longer  but i think my dog just chewed off the end of the central threaded stick and then easily removed the treats as usual  enjoyable but expensive for the short amount of time they last  also  not sure of the calorie count  my dog is an 85lb young male german shepherd 
product	a little pricey  but my cat seems to like it  i give it 3 stars  i think these cans are worth half the price asked for 
product	i liked these treats for my dog and he seemed to find them very tasty  then i read they were made in china    given other pet food product issues that originated there  i threw the several bags purchased away 
product	my dog has no interest in this toy at all  i have the treats in it and all and she does not even roll it around  waste of money 
quality	my cat is 19 and losing weight because he will not eat dry food  or canned cat food  he will eat tuna  which does not provide the fat  and nutrients he needs  claudius hates this stuff  and sneezes if i bring it near  i am using a syringe for feeding a cat liquid medicine  it is getting the nutri cal into him  and he is eating a bit more  but the clean up is ridiculous  my fingers get greasy  and claudius has grease all over his chin  and his front  if you can get this into your finicky cat  they will get their nutrition  i hope you have a cat that likes this  because that makes it easier 
product	duck breast filets are great  but the cost is outrageous  i paid  27 for product 32 oz  and shipping  now i can buy it from costco for  14  40 oz  i will never buy it from your vendor again 
quality	if i could select zero stars for a rating  i would    the merrick product is excellent    it is the vendor that stinks     if you look at the same product sold here on amazon from other vendors  the 34 count box sells for less than  35 00 and not over  100 00  you can even by them one sausage at a time on azmazon for less than  1 25 each so why buy it from this vendor for 3 times the price    i did just that by mistake thinking it was for four boxes of the 34 count and not one  btw  you can buy one of these little suasages for less than  2 00 retail at most pet stores  the merrick product is great  this vendor is ripping us off  be wise     still buy merricck products on amazon but not from this vendor  i now have to be bothered with \\ fighting\\  and being hassled in order to get my money back because this vendor has no return policy  what a surprise   i am livid   
product	i bought this product to get rid of ticks on my dogs  however  it did not get rid of many of them  perhaps it would work better to get rid of fleas or other bugs  i have used similar products where you have to put the medicine on various parts of the back from the neck to the tail making sure to put it directly on the skin and not the hair  so i did not apply it wrong  as i said before  i would not buy this product again to get rid of ticks  i was really disappointed because this products is expensive and i did not get the results i hoped for  oh well  i will go back to the shampoo i used before that worked well  but it dried my dogs fur out 
health	this does seem to help my cat with his diarrhea  but i had to mix it in with wet food to get him to eat it  i had a free sample of something called intelliflora that he seemed to like the taste of better  so  i have ordered that  it seems to work just as well or better  i would actually recommend intelliflora over the fortiflora  it is less expensive too 
quality	one of my kittens  both under a year old  likes this dental treat kind of  my other kitten will not eat it  i honestly do not know how petrodex works but it is a pain to take off the paper wrapping from each piece and then crumbling it so my kittens can eat it  i will not be purchasing again 
product	this was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs  maybe my dog is just spoiled  but she treats these like third class treats  it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy  more often than not  she will simply walk away from these  glad other people like them  but i will not be buying them again 
health	i bought this product to help me transition my cat  killer  from kibble to wet food  from what i would read about 70 percent of cats love the taste of this stuff and will be much more likely to eat something sprinkled with it  killer is indifferent to the stuff <br  ><br  >for those of you looking to use fortiflora for it is intended function  apparently it is very helful for feline digestive issues 
product	i almost fell over when i opened the bag  product was rotten  i returned it for a full refund 
product	almost every order was delivered with some of the cans dented  this last order actually had a can damaged so badly that it was open  we did not initially observe the broken can  after about a week in our pantry the smell was unbearable  we inspected numerous items from the pantry before determining that the smell was coming from the mighty dog  worms were observed in one open can  we got rid of the offending can and about 4 others that had fluid from the broken can  we immediately cancelled any future orders 
product	nothing particularly special about these biscuits  you can probably go less expensive for better quality or more expensive for better quality  does my dog like them  yes  but he also eats everything he can off the sidewalk 
product	just when i think i have found a treat to outsmart my lab she proves me wrong  it took her only 5 minutes to snap one end of the rod  she enjoys the treats  but it is just not worth the money 
quality	this last batch of 24 cans was different in texture and quality  not flakes  more like mush  my cat does not like it anymore <br  >my cat loves this flaked fish  and fish is the first ingredient  sometimes local stores are out of this product  also this is a great price 
product	the concept is good  the snack is nutritious  but in ordering from amazon  there was practically nothing but dust in the bag  the couple of treats that were left uncrushed were practically air and my 71 pound dog looked at me as if i were playing a joke on her 
quality	my maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats  i have tried offering them to her and she will not eat it  i tried putting them in her food and she will just pick around it  i have only tried peanut butter and salmon  i bought all three flavors  i plan on trying the chicken one soon to see if she likes that one  but i do not think it will win her over
quality	i got the small ball because i have a chihuahua that will inhale her food  i removed the internal disc because the kibble i use  very small  would not come out with that disc in  it is very noisy rolling around on my floors and scares another little chihuahua that does not like noises  i always have to open it to get the last of the food out because it is bottom heavy even when almost empty  i would not purchase this again  i like the purple disc type treat container toys better  those are alway emptied and not noisy 
product	scam  scam  scam  scam 15bucks for a box and a seperate piece of cardboard <br  ><br  >this product is easy enough to put together  easy enough to follow the instructions  but lets just say the hole for the bottle is to big and is in the wrong location for it to even hold its place  this is an interesting idea  but is not worth the money   get a regular box from your po its cheaper   not to mention you do not need to pay 6bucks to return it  <br  ><br  >it does not come with a presized bottle  or any support for holding the bottle in place   i have to manually edit mine  <br  ><br  >i ve made better effective toys out of cardboard boxes  including flipbox puzzles that deliver treats   out of boxes the treats come in   and honestly i will not be buying anything like this again  but seeing how it is built and designed i figure i can make my own and train my dogs to play doggy basketball   seriously not worth the money   especially not 15bucks with shipping  <br  ><br  >if you want to not be scammed make your own  cut a box bottom off halfway for the ball to slide throu leave the top open and add a slant with another seperate square  <br  ><br  >if you carefully measure you can make one that will actually works  
product	we do not feed our dogs treats made in china  nothing on the website or on amazon com let us know these treats are made in china 
quality	our dog will not eat the wellness wellbar yogurt  apples and bananas dog treats  however  we crush two of these up for each daily feeding and mix them with his regular dog food  for this reason i would not buy these crunchy treats again  although i must say they smell good  we feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year  he loves these    asin b0002h3r2e wellness wellbar yogurt  apples and bananas dog treats  50 ounce pouch  
product	i bought these for my cat and if i give them to him  he will eat them  but it is not the type of treat he will do tricks for or run over to eat  it is a healthier alternative to other treats  but i would not buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior  these treats simply do not entice him enough to really be a treat 
health	i have a 4 000 gallon pond with waterfall in my backyard  i ordered this product because it claimed to be harmless to plants  and a reasonable price  and there are some plants that cascade throughout the waterfall area of the water feature  i drained and cleaned my pond before using this product  i followed the directions but became disappointed when the algae growth continued  it seemed to slow the growth  but it did not prevent the takeover of the awful green algae  i used the entire container over the course of several weeks  i cannot recommend this product 
product	i think my cats eat it for variety s sake  but the texture is really  sticky   the cat that tends to lick  rather than bite  at the food  ends up plastering this against the plate  eating only 2  of it  i have to unstick it for her a few times per serving  i would not buy this again 
product	yes  the cat ate the friskies  on may 2  2011  i ordered a case of friskies through subscribe   save  every two months  because it was affordable   11  and convenient  today  i logged on to get an early shipment  but the friskies 24 count cat food price went up  20  i wont pay  1 34 can for friskies cat food  i cancelled my subscribe   save order  i am disappointed with amazon and friskies  i realize s s prices can fluctuate  and some of my other items have gone up or down  1 or so  that is fine  the friskies price hike exceeds expensive brick and mortar grocery stores  even  27 is ridiculously expensive  this is the fourth time we have had issues with the subscribe   save program  unfortunately  i also noticed that amazon used a lot of the plastic packaging bags although the items sent together were not breakable 
product	this is a great product but unfortunately the price has continued to rise  it is now cheaper for me to buy this product at walmart   13 63 including tax  for a package of 24 instead of paying the  14 44  subscribe   save   when i add my  1 coupon the price was  12 63  the price of this product on amazon used to be  11 12 less than 6 months ago  since then it has continued to increase and has gone up by 29 86   i rated this product a 2 5 due to the high price and the unreasonable increase in price over the past 6 months  i will buy again if the price goes down to that of walmart   jon 
product	this may not be a fair review as i have only used one time  my dog seems to shed worse  maybe she just needs a good brushing and after that she will not shed as much as she does    do not really know  i will circle back if my feelings have changed
quality	my dog did not take to these at all  he knows what he likes and does not like   so he just sniffed the bisquit and walked away  oh well  i gave it 3 stars because it is a good product  my dog just did not like them 
product	i am revising my earlier review  i was very satisfied with my first order regarding expiry date and product quality  i recommended to buy again  my second purchase got me products with less than 6 months to expiry  when i peeled off the expiry date stickers  i saw the original expiry date printed on the package was 1 jan 2011 or 9 months ago  i will not buy this product again
product	i would never recommend this k9 advantix ii to anyone <br  >i used this product as instructed   my puppy weighs 7 lbs <br  >it was no more effective than putting water on my dog s back <br  >waste of money <br  >now i have to search for another product 
quality	i bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog  she would eat them if i handed them to her  but they definitely were not good enough for her to come running to me on a recall  that makes them kind of useless as training treats  which they are perfectly sized for  she also got serious gas from these treats   which suggests they are probably lower quality food  maybe your dog will like them  but if he she s picky  do not bother  i just buy franks at the store and cut them up small  it is cheaper by far  and i can eat them as well  i usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up  then they make perfect treats that do not make your hands sticky  but my dog likes them fresh a little better  just a heads up 
product	i ordered this product because of research and finding this to be one of the best foods for dogs  the food came and looked fine until i picked up a can only to find the bottom smashed in  i had checked the box carefully when it came and knew that this was not from shipping  every single can in the case was the same  i called amazon and they asked me if i wanted a refund or replacement to which i answered replacement  i figured that i would give the company one more chance because of the rave reviews  that replacement order came today and it was the same story   every can smashed on the bottom  i am not talking a little dented either  we are talking smashed and unsafe  i called amazon again and did receive a refund and we put the entire case in the trash  i received also some of the dry food from this company  because frankly i do not feel like getting more smashed cans  anyway that came today as well and i have hopes it will be fine  crazy though that all those cans made it out of their production plant without being spotted  crazy and a little scary 
quality	my 8 year old yorkie does not like it    he only eats when he is hungry  i rate it as 3 star since my dog still eats it 
quality	i have two dogs and one of them did not like the treats at all  she refused to eat any of them no matter how small  my other dog  who will eat anything  and i mean that   loves them  so i will not purchase them anymore since i want something they both like
product	whiskers temptations kitty treats are very good  but the price to high  i can buy the same product locally at 1 4 what you charged for them and also comes in a mega package still cheaper than the cost i paid from amazon  ajd
product	my friend has one of these and it keeps her dog occupied for hours which allowed her to study or whatever she needed to do  so i decided to try it  my 2 1 2 year old mini dachshund figured out how to pop the hard treat out in less than 5 min  if this was it  i would not have a problem because she is pretty smart  but it says on the package virtually indestructible and she tore chunks out of the thing you put the treats in  i have never had a problem with her ripping things  other than cheap stuffed animals if she can get them  and she bit chunks off  it is a good idea and works for some  but definitely not hard to destroy as they claim  at least not for her   
health	it seems to be working   not cured yet  my dog is still shaking his head  i read all the reviews from bad to best and was convinced it could work for my tucker  we will keep trying 
product	three plastic bottles of the synergylabs shed x were received at our local post office which  in turn  called me because they refused to deliver the package  it was leaking like a sieve  oil saturated the inner and outer layers of cardboard  i sent a packaging complaint to the supplier and never heard from them that was several weeks ago  in the process i ruined a pair of pants and a shirt trying to unpack the leaking bottles  i strongly urge you to avoid this product and company   it neither understands packaging nor decent customer relations 
product	well  i had high hopes for these treats  which are small  and smell terrible  they are semi moist treats  other than the smell  they seem like a fine product  just not for my boy wesley  he was totally uninterested  he sniffed it once  and that was it  he would not even chase it when it rolled across the room   a clear poor sign   so  although the resealable packaging is great  and the cat depicted on the bag is cute  this will not be a winner in our household  perhaps a different flavor would be better  one thing to note  wesley has not had semi moist treats before  so that could be it as well  hopefully your cat will have happier results 
product	waste of money  does not work  my dog is not even too fond of the treats  save your money and get something else <br  >it is pretty cute to look at for me  but doggie wasnt interested 
quality	this brand was recommended to me by a dear friend and famous breeder  i bought the lamb because i have one cat who is on a proplan lamb diet for sensitive skin and stomachs  this flavor was just too bland  though  when you open the can it is a solid grey hard lump of food  the cats would not touch it  i had to mash it up and mix it with proplan kitten food to get them to eat it  i still have several cans that may not get used  i have now switched to the rabbit diet and the cats like that  i even have a subscription for the rabbit diet  so it is automatically delivered at a 15  reduced price  whenever i like  pretty cool 
quality	my cats would not eat these  gave some to a friend who is cat would not eat them  gave some to my daughter in law who is cats would not eat them 
product	let me start things off by saying that overall i love this toy  and i truly wish i could give it five stars  unfortunately  the durability leaves something to be desired  i have a 30lb australian cattle dog  she is not getting any bigger and she is not destructive with her toys  i supervise all of the times she would play with this toy  and i can guarantee it was never able to fit inside her mouth  what she was able to do  though  was pick it up by the dispensing hole  she would hook it with her teeth  and move across the room with it where she would then drop it  i do not know if this is what would cause damage  my entire home is carpeted so i do not think so   or when it would bang into the wall  but  the threads on the cover seemed to crack and break off very easily  we are currently on our third one  two have broken so far within a short period of time  i have taken a star away for each broken item   i now only give this one to her occasionally  substituting the kong wobbler most days  in hopes that it will last longer  yes  the toy has popped open occasionally  but that is due to me not closing it tight enough  and there is never any excess damage when this happens since she is supervised and i can see when this happens  i love the fact that there are varying levels of difficulty with this toy  and my pup truly does love playing with it  if the top cover were as durable as the bottom then i would give 5 stars  no questions asked 
product	the product is fine but amazon should have packed it better  the case was damaged with three cans opened within the case causing the food to come out all over the other cans   what a mess    bubble wrap would have helped  they simply put the case in a box with a lot of space and no additional packaging 
product	was unaware this product was made and irradiated in china amazon should really have a country of origin for all products listed on amazon com especially when irradiated i am quite uncomfortable with buying food products made in china  even more so for pet products  where the track record is dubious at best  i know the fda approves of food irradiation  but i remain skeptical and china s guidelines on pet goods especially  are much more laxed than those of the fda
product	unlike other ratatouille products  which are several to a package  this treat is one huge quiche  and is larger than your average rat  i guess i should have taken a better look at the product photo  with any small animal  you have to keep the portions small     i am not quite sure how to deploy this mega treat  the shipping charge was disconcertingly high compared to the cost of the product  again  look before you leap  ratatouille used to be relatively rare in stores  but they are easier to find on shelves nowadays  making them not as good a deal online as they used to be 
quality	this is a well thought out bag and is comfortable to use but the execution leaves much to be desired  the velcro on both of mine started coming loose after a month  also the strap stitching does not look very solid  there s only a single line of it instead of either a zig zag or a cross  and the cut ends started unraveling immediately and needed to be sealed with a flame  both problems are easy to fix but i do not think that i should have to be dealing with them  my premier treat pouch is still in one piece  although i do not like it as much as this one  do not get this bag unless you are handy with a needle and thread 
product	first the good news  my cats  all 7 of them  absolutely love this food  2 of our most finicky will eat almost nothing else  but they gobble this down  clearly this is a good tasting food <br  ><br  >now the bad news  seems very expensive for what you get  a look at the ingredient list reveals by products and several grain fillers such as wheat gluten that you do not usually find in a so called \\ premium\\  food  not sure why exactly it is so expensive  they also do not even make this available in a 5 5 or 6 oz can  only the 3 oz size   so for multiple cat households the cost of these little cans can really add up in a hurry <br  ><br  >so bottom line  it is definitely a good tasting food and if your cats are picky eaters it is worth a try  however  the high cost and lack of a larger can option makes this a tough sell  i am trying to find a better more economical food that all of my cats will like  so i can transition them off this 
quality	package full of alot of very small broken pieces and tiny chips  not whole slices as shown  dogs were not very interested in them  in the future i will make my own in a dehydrator and try again  way too expensive for what you get 
product	my cats go nuts for this but it is way to expensive  also  i have purchased 10 20 bags at one time and alot of the bags contained mostly crushed  powdery ingredients in the bags  i do not know why this is but i am not going to spend all that money for powder instead of pieces of the treats  it is a shame because it is an excellent product but who can afford it 
product	i did not look carefully at the ingredient list before i ordered these treats  they contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so i ended up sending them back  they are a hard  crunchy treat so your dog will have to use the back molars to chew them where it would be easy to get a cavity  while they smelled great and have some quality ingredients in them  for me it just was not worth taking that chance when there are lots of other great dog treats out there  where i will not have this worry  to get instead 
product	i did not look carefully at the ingredients  list when i ordered these treats  once they arrived  i noticed they contain molasses which can cause tooth decay so i ended up sending them back  they are a hard  crunchy treat so your dog is definitely going to use the back teeth to chew them where they could get a cavity  while they smell great and contain some healthy ingredients  it just was not worth it to me to take that chance  there are other tasty dog treats on the market that i will not have that worry with so i sent them back 
product	my pup s love it but  its made in china and will be the last time i will purchase it  i am all about buying american in the future 
product	a very strange treat   dogs did not like any of the varieties we tried and i ordered three different varieties <br  >not a  strip  but a baked  cookie  that was really very hard and more of a chunk of something backed  not meat looking or smelling <br  >just really weird and i would never buy them again  save your money and buy the chicken jerky treats at walgreens that are a bone fide strip of chicken and dogs love them  these are chunks of mystery material and not at all appetizing 
product	the jar arrived well packaged and looked just like the picture  but the seal was shabby from the beginning  it was really hard to open and close the lid  especially if you are doing this daily to get treats out   and our lid cracked in half after one week  very disappointing 
product	i am disappointed with this purchase  it is really hard to get the food out from the inner area and even worse waiting to get it out of the ball  i should have returned it but have had it sitting since the without being used since first week i had it and it is probaly too late 
quality	useless  since cat refuses to eat it  he does not like the taste  waste  does not seems to do much even when i force feed 
product	i normally like the natural balance sweet potato   venison or sweet potato and bison  but this 14oz bag came busted up and the treats are a bigger size than the size in a smaller bag  the treats were really brittle and broke easily  i would not buy this one any more but will buy the smaller ones in a store 
quality	tried the shredded type first and the cats would not touch any of the three flavors sooooo i tried the pate type and they disliked these 3 flavors toooo  i sure was disappointed because the subscription price and convience is so nice   but if the cats will not eat it   the subcription had to be cancelled  i gave it 2 stars because of the convience and price of the subscription service 
product	i had previously bought the algae fix from the same company  but because of reading the review about this product thought to try it  my pond turned dark and murky within 2 weeks and never went back to the clarity it had with the original product  i was especially disappointed because i had just drained and cleaned the pond prior to this  i will be going back to the other product  unfortunately  i had bought 2 gallons 
health	gave this product to my 1 year old cocker spaniel  who decided that she likes to eat her frozen poop  every time i gave this to her  it made her vomit      and she still eats her poop  did not work for us at all 
quality	my cat  who goes crazy for liv a lil s freeze dried treats  will not touch these  they are actually quite different from what i expected  they are soft in consistency  not hard like i would expect from something \\ freeze dried \\  and not flaky like i would expect from fish  it s more like fish that has been ground and then formed into chunks  as opposed to real chunks of freeze dried fish   the chunks were also brown  instead of red like the photo 
health	my fault since i did not research the ingredients  my dog has allergies and is on a grain free diet but also cannot have potatoes and there are potatoes in the ingredients  dummy me did not look at the ingredients before giving him a treat for three days and then his itchiness started up  stopped the product and within a couple of days  itchiness gone  wish they made this for allergy prone dogs 
health	my cat hates this type of food  she even lost weight because she wouldnt eat it  so i started buying friskees classic pate canned cat food and she cannot get enough of that  she licks the plate dry now  she also loves dry cat food  who wouldve figured  but she hates this filet stuff  what will i do with my 1 1 2 cases of prime filet 
product	not worth the money  i received 7 small treats  there are many more quality treats out there for your money many more  look around  would not even consider purchasing again 
product	my two weimaraners shredded the ball within minutes  what a waste  do not buy if your dog is a chewer  also  not meant for use with kibble    comes out in handfuls 
quality	regular flavor budda bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these 
product	you would assume if you are giving the dimension of a ball  the measurment would be the diameter  description says ball is 5\\   packaging of product says 5\\   when i received this  it looked too small to be 5\\   so i measured it and found that the diameter is only marginally bigger than 4\\  diameter  4 1 8\\  107mm   there is nothing on this ball that measures 5\\   this makes a big difference when buying toys for pets  4\\  is small enough that my large dog could easily grab it in her mouth and bite down breaking  chewing  swallowing small pieces of the hard plastic  all these toys say \\ supervise\\  your pet  but you cannot realistically keep your eyes on them 100  of the time  i thought i had found a great toy to keep my dog mentally stimulated  as it is a great concept  unfortunately i returned the item not willing to risk it 
product	when i opened up the package and looked inside    every single treat was covered in a slightly furry white film  i realized that they were all covered in mold and ended up throwing the entire package away 
health	while my dogs loved these  several hours after eating one they both vomited  the next day i gave them each another one and they both vomited again 
quality	my cats love these  so i was puzzled when i opened a new bag and they refused to eat them day after day  i took a whiff and they are stale  i checked the date stamp on the bag  and they expired a month after i received them  so i guess i need to order one bag at a time from now on since i cannot find them at the pet stores anymore 
product	nov 2011  i previously gave a 5 star rating for this product  i have ordered this product every month for several months including the jerky product  but  one of my poodles has become ill  these products are made in china <br  ><br  >yes  my poodles love this product  we will no longer order this product  i pray amazon will take this product off their market   asin b0009yd8jc chicken skewers dog treats  4oz  
product	my standard poodles chewed through this flimsy thing in about 20 minutes  i wish i could have my money back 
quality	have bought these before from a local pet food store and they were wonderful  these however were not fresh  my little yorkie  who loves and never had a problem eating the previous ones from the pet food store cannot even eat these  they are horribly old and dried out  will not be ordering these from amazon again just to save time  do not buy them from amazon 
quality	rusty got tired of pushing it with his nose so he brilliantly took the whole thing in his mouth and bit down hard which distorted the ball into popping open  he is a 60 pound aussie dingo lab mix  with longer than expected teeth and a bite force like a pit bull <br  ><br  >this ball not being good for big strong chewers would be worthy of 4 stars  i took off another 2 stars because the diameter of the ball  measured by me  is almost exactly 4 inches  the ball s label states 5 inches  rusty probably could not have easily destroyed a 5  34  ball too big to fit in his mouth  i do not like being lied to  i would return it to amazon but it is pretty much toast from rusty s   34 enthusiasm  34  <br  ><br  >i recommend feeding puzzles for any dog smart and motivated enough to use them  this would be fine for smaller dogs  if you do not mind being lied to  
product	what were they thinking when they made these  dog spit out  she hates these things  whatever the heck they are  she is a dog treat nut but this stuff  blaaahhh   next time someone should taste test  i will give to squirrels   they eat everything  i hate tossing money away  but they were made in china   what did i expect 
product	i was feeding \\ taste of the wild\\  dog food to my new puppy because i wanted to make sure he got the most nutritious food  i bought a number of dog treats like these along the same line  and of course dogs will eat anything  however the cost is about double what i normally pay for such as   asin b0006nehmi wellness wellbar crunchy peanut and honey dog treats  20 ounce pouch    so i would not buy these again unless you have money to burn   
product	bag is stiff fabric    hinge is difficult to open    i would compartment is too small to hold anything but an i would card    front pocket is virtually useless for poop bags    treat portion is deep and would hold other items but they obstruct access to the treats  designer may be a great trainer but designer not at all  will try to wash it to soften up but it probably will be relegated to the several useless items i have wasted    on <br  >outward hound treat bag is great except mesh tears when attacked by puppy teeth    wish they made one w  pockets 
product	i bought this for my basenji jack russell mix and this thing is way too big for him to play with  i wish i had inspected the toy dimensions  6\\  x 6\\  x 6\\   before buying this  it also does not really seem to dispense the little treats i bought for it  so i am starting to wonder if you need special treats for it or something because the treats either come out way too fast or barely at all  i bought a kong ball to replace it and he is much happier with that 
health	i should have realized why there was no ingredient information   this is a horrible product filled with tons of corn  corn meal   bad stuff  my cat coughed up hairballs the very next day and days after so product with all its bad ingredients does not even work  i now suspect the few other reviews that were positive were probably written by a seller or manufacturer 
product	i did not realize these bones had a layer of meat like product  this layer crumbles and scatters all over the place and is bright red  on the plus side  my puppy loves it  would not purchase again though  because it is such a mess
product	the add originally posted did not have the weight of the dog food in the add  in fact  under product review  it claims its weight is 41 s  when i received the package of only 8 s  i was disappointed with the size vs the cost  i am a new amazon food consumer  i will continue to order but will be more wary of quantity vs cost especially with these types of items  the product is great and i did receive it in a timely manner  aside from a delay due to weather storm in the southeastern mountains 
product	this was a waste of money and very wobbly  it is made out of cardboard and i just let the dog eat the cardboard because he hated the \\ toy\\ 
product	i bought this for my boston terrier  cookie  who can destroy most toys in less than an hour  i thought the idea of a treat inside would slow her down a little  unfortunately  the treat did not suit her finicky palate  and she simply worked it out of the ball and left it on the floor  the ball itself  however  has turned out to be cookie proof  months after the purchase  she still plays with it  it bounces nicely  and does not roll under the furniture as much as other balls  i have also found that if i stuff it with her regular treats  small bits of chicken jerky  or her kibble  it does keep her occupied for a while  although she chews on it  i can find very little evidence of toothmarks  so whatever this is made of is pretty strong  i would give this more stars if it was easier to load  but then it would probably be easier for her to un load  overall  a tough little toy  and one of cookie s favorites  a little pricey  but hey  she is worth it 
health	my boy cocker spaniel has really bad allergies  i had been feeding him and his sister the paul newman organic food but my baby kept getting blisters on his belly and scratched like crazy  he was on steriods and antibiotics more then he was off of them  my vet suggested he may be allergic to chicken or grains  he said fish was the best protien so i switched them to natural balance  with the weening off the other food and the doing the old 75  to 25  then 50  to 50   you get where i am going  they have been solely on this food for two weeks  i have not seen a big difference in the scratching in fact the girl is scrathing now  but this food stinks  i have a strong stomach but i gag everytime i have to feed them and they stink  they mostly stay in the house during the day  i when i come home from work and open the door  my house stinks and so do they  they sleep with us at night and their breath reaks and so do they and of course they have to lay right on me  i am going to give it another 30 days but if the allergies do not improve this stinky food may have to go   
health	our two cats eat a variety of non pate  chunky canned cat foods without any issue but this particular one seems to give them slight diarrhea  this has happened with two separate orders  maybe it is something just specific to us our cats as the product appears fine to me  but i wanted to give this heads up 
quality	my small shih tzu mix really could care less about the treat ball  if i throw it  she will run and get it like any other ball  but does not spend time try to get the treat out  she will do tricks for other types of treats 
health	but it does get chewed down to some small pieces of which i am careful about as they look like they could cause choking 
product	these were very expensive  we got 2 of them   gave for christmas presents and the dogs have already chewed holes in them  3 days later   i would not recommend this product  needs to be made of more sturdy rubber 
health	this product was first purchased where i took my dog for grooming my groomer said her dogs just love them and they are all natural which i thought was great  found same product on amazon so purchased it on line  my dog loved them and was given one a day before i became aware they were made in china  there has not been any health problems of any kind with my little dog which i am thankful for but i am not sure if the product is to be trusted only because that is where the tainted dog food was made  the groomers dogs have them a few times aday and they are just fine  happy and healthy dogs  it would be up to the purchaser if they wanted to buy them for their pet 
quality	for whatever reason  my dog is not very interested in the round gnawhide  she loves the busy buddy rectangular strips  so i do not think it is a flavor issue  i will not be buying these again 
product	it is cute and once you put it together  it works okay  but really   15 for folded cardboard  maybe if it came with the bottle  pre cut and maybe some treats it would be worth it but it really is just not worth this much money 
quality	i wish i could give a better review but our dog does not like the taste of these dry treats  he pretty much eats anything so it was a surprise to see him pass these treats up
product	these treats are so hard that i have to take a mallet out on a hard floor with a newspaper to break them up to give to my dog  i would not buy them again  my dog is a chewer  but these have no appeal to him unless i break them up first  and he loves duck treats 
quality	i ordered these because my dogs have had them before and liked them  the picture shows the mints as off white or light brown  the ones that i got were a darker brown and my dogs do not like them  they smell awful  i was very disappointed and so were my dogs 
quality	i try to treat my cats with vitamins during the winter to avoid kitty colds  but i cannot even get them to look twice at these  they are too hard   not really chewy  and smell awful even to the cats  the only remedy for now is grinding them up while i wait for my order of nu cat soft chews  that the cats treat like pounce   not happy with this product 
product	great treat  dog loved em  small and good for training  but they smelled pretty bad  we got the salmon and the chicken and both had an offensive odor  will not buy again for that reason 
quality	unless your dog is an outside dog that lives outside and would be gnawing on these in your yard these beef tendons stink  their smell permeates the entire house  for that reason alone i would have a difficult time purchasing them again  their odor is horrific 
product	i was told this would ship for free and there was a shipping cost of more than it cost and they would not let me cancell it i will refuse it on my credit card for fraud i will never buy from amazon again
product	the actual product is great   i guess  as my cat loves it  however  the package was badly damaged and i had to throw out six cans that were crushed open  some lackey at the warehouse either did not care or thought it was funny to ship a damaged product  i would say i would buy again if things were made right  they were not  so i won t  edit  i tried again because my cat really loves this crap and none of the cans were broken still some dents  but meh    packaging much improved 
health	i used the product as directed  and was pleased with it is immediate results  i thought for sure we could kick my beagles ear infection in a week or so  but after two weeks  the infection had lessened  but not disappeared  i attribute this to the product acting more like an ear wash  and less like an antibiotic  had to go to the vet and get a prescription anyway  might work for you  who knows 
product	i have a difficult time finding blue products in our area  and when i do they frequently do not have exactly what i am looking for <br  ><br  >so i was thrilled to find amazon had several products available <br  ><br  >how disappointing to receive the product and find that it was several months past the date stamped on the packaging  as a longtime amazon shopper i was surprised   i have come to expect great delivery and quality product  i will not order the blue again from this source 
quality	i thought this was the same or at least similar quality to the cadet brand  i received it today and am sending this back  the pieces are dried out bits  smelled strange  too  completely different from natural duck jerky that i am used to seeing  will not be buying this brand again 
product	when this arrived there were no whole dog treats in the bag  the bag was filled with what looked like coffee grounds except it was moving  with dozens of live maggots  this was the worst amazon purchase ever  do not buy this product 
product	this product looks just as advertised  and it must be tasty  because our mid sized  40 lbs  dog devoured the entire thing within 15 minutes  it does not fit inside the medium everlasting glo ball  so get the large size  if you plan to use this product with that toy  product was received way ahead of schedule  so pleased with delivery 
product	i am always looking for healthy treats for my dogs  i had ordered 2 boxes of these and when i opened the first box something had eaten their way in or out  the treats were full of holes and there were also holes in the plastic  i could not see from the outside any evidence of something getting in  they were also out of date by a couple of months  i contacted the the people that i purchased these from and they wasted no time in giving me a refund  i was very please with the seller s response 
product	they advertised that these now came in a 3 lb  bag  for a certain amount of money  calculating that price  it was less expensive to buy them in bulk  instead  they sent me six 6 6oz  bags   not equaling 3 lbs  and it ended up more costly then buying them here  my dogs love this product  but it was false advertising  i got ripped off for 12oz  of product  if they were going to send me 6oz bags  there should have been 8  never again 
product	i bought a bag of these to try with my finicky elkhound  he liked them so i bought the six bag value pack  all was well with the first couple of bags or so i thought  towards the end of the bag i noticed some white film on the nuggets  i became concerned so i looked at the remaining unopened bags and sure enough they were covered with white mold  i called the whole healthy pet store that sold them to me and todd was more than accomodating  he said to mail them back and he would replace them  he said he contacted free range and they knew there was a problem but that they had fixed it  i got my replacement bags and the first bag was fine but when i got out the next bag again the treats were covered with white mold  i called todd and he was terrific  he refunded my money and pulled the product from his stock  i called free range to see why they had not notified the public about this problem and the very rude person who answered their phone stated that it was not her job  i will never buy products from free range and am worried about what feeding these treats has done to my dog  be very careful about feeding your dog their products   
product	bought this product for my dog who was verified to have ringworm by a scrape and petri dish  vet gave conofite and after 3 weeks  no improvement  got desperate and heard about sulfine  bought it  and expected results in 3 5 days  after 1 week  no change  hair did not grow back  skin color still dark  looked to get a refund  but then read the fine print that said i need to buy the entire kit in order to get a refund  i only bought the 2 oz  cream  so i am stuck with something that does not work 
quality	i would  neither of my  two  cats recognize this as actual food  they just think i am making them smell something  they do not understand that they are supposed to try and eat it  do not purchase this  it is a waste of your money  i needed something to put pills in for my female cat as she is tired of  pill pockets  and will not eat them anymore  i guess i am on the lookout for new products   any suggestions  
quality	my dog seems to really like these  i am sure they are not the healthiest dog treat out there  but hey we all splurge sometimes  for some reason he will not eat the kong while we are away from home  at work  but once we are home and he is had his walk he usually goes and finds his kong and carries it out to the mat at the front door to enjoy his treat  i sometimes add peanut butter to it or plain yogurt  he digs it  the only problem is my dog gives up too easy  if the ziggie breaks off leaving half of it too far for him to reach it  he is over it  he will just leave it there  leaving me to have to dig it out for him later 
quality	i think the dogs liked them  but the smell does not allure them to take it right away  they left them and came back later  they are very hard  one of my dogs cannot eat  too hard to bite  they are ok 
health	we order this for our diabetic cat  she has done well for three years with insulin shots twice a day  but we wanted to save the trip to the vets for bloodwork updates and insulin adjustments  we thought we would stress her out less and save a few dollars  looking at paperwork that came with package we decided to call company and get a report of what is in the little pieces of paper that you place in the litter box  they sent out the requested paperwork  upon reading it we decided it may not be worth the risk to the cat   if the cat while cleaning herself injected the tiny papers that have chemicals on it  our vets is close to our house and we will have your monitored that way  on the other hand  we think it is a great product if you can monitor your cat when it exits the cat box and make sure there are no test papers on it is fur  that may work  when we used the test we did not get a color change  not sure if the cat was in normal range or the test was flawed  we would have to use a few times to really know for sure 
product	i bought 4 of these buffalo spiral bully sticks  when they arrived 3 of them were extremely small smaller then a pencil  and only 1 of them looked liked the picture and was a descent size  i would not buy this product again unless they guarantee the thickness of the product  in the picture they provide thick bully spirals but be aware when you get them some are thinner than a pencil 
product	i have ordered these duck treats from you several times  2 3 bags ea order   i was always very pleased  the last time i ordered   3 bags  the \\ use by\\  date on all three packages had already expired  i have one full bag left which i am going to toss in the trash  my little girls  gabby and lola  are turning them down because they are old and hard  like i said  this is the first of maybe 6 seperate orders where i have been totally discouraged and disgusted with the quality  i need to make another order  but not sure i if should take another chance 
health	maybe what the box claims is true  no additive  no coloring  etc  however i did not notice it was made in china until i have looked at the bottom tip of the bag  using tiny font size  more like 6pt   it states the product is made in china  while i appreciate the honesty  i could not trust the quality of the sweet potato itself  and i found that out after feeding a couple of them to my dogs  i am not stating all chinese products are bad  however  most of produce i have dealt with came with great disappointment  to make matters worse  my two little dogs got sick  i have stopped feeding them and now they are ok  i still have 4 bags left but i plan to throw them away 
health	the product arrived in just a few days  the gal at the animal shelter said she had never known a pet to not drink clinicare  my sick cat drank it once then vomited  evidently it did not agree with her  she would not drink it again  it may work for your pet but did not for mine 
product	i have ordered this product several times and each time it came fine  the last time it came frozen but was discolored through and through  brown and grey instead of red  all 8 bags  amazon was great  they credited me immediately  but could not tell me what the problem was except it was safe to reorder  i have put in multiple calls to paw naturaw including emails without a response   i have had easy communication with them on 1 other occasion  are they having problems  was it a warehouse problem  is it safe to order  was everything ok and i was wrong  not a call back over 3 weeks  folks this is raw food and any change needs an explanation  i will now only buy the product locally  much more expensive i do not think i can afford it  and am considering switching to an alternate brand  my dog loves this stuff and i am writing this review because if others have had this problem then there is something wrong and paw naturaw needs to address it  if it is an isolated event it also needs explanation  bottom line  company cannot sell raw food and ignore important questions  why are they ignoring legitimate questions  i do not want them to go out of business or be hurt  they need to get their act together as far as customers are concerned <br  >when you pay  35 to  50 for a weeks worth of dog food the manufacturer should at least address your concerns 
product	it is overpriced for something that must be used up within 2 3 weeks after opening  also  it crumbles so much that you lose 20  of what you bought as dust at the bottom  the brand and quality are among the best out there  and the dog loves it  but this treat is more trouble than it is worth  alternatives with similar quality and flavor    asin b000084f44 old mother hubbard bitz treats assorted chicken  liver and vegetable flavors     asin b0002hbn0m old mother hubbard flavored bitz     asin b0018cea50 canidae dog treats  snap biscuits lamb   rice flavor  4 pound bag     asin b001eo6h26 castor   pollux organix dog cookies  peanut butter flavor  12 ounce boxes  pack of 4      asin b000084f1z natural balance potato and duck formula dog treats  14 ounce bag     asin b0030f70nm dogswell biscuits with benefits  vitality bacon   white cheddar treats for all dogs  10 ounce pouches  pack of 6   
health	my dog likes these well enough and i feel great that he is not getting potentially harmful chicken from china  most of them come from china   but for the price  there is not much in the canister 
quality	what more can i say  i usually buy this kind of treat at our local discount shopping center  but i realized those dumbells were made in china  and that made me nervous after all the quality control problems china has had with pet foods and treats  if i remember correctly  i think these are made in the us  so i felt better about giving these to my dog  too bad she would not eat them  picky  picky 
product	my first annoyance was the amount of time delivery took  i have ordered and used this product through another supplier  and it was fast and effective  delivery   pest control   i know it took about a week or more to get shipping info and the product  i also feel either this batch was not as good or it was  bootleg  because it was only 2 3 weeks at best of pest control 
product	this toy is worthless     you place the kibble inside  twist to close and they are supposed to have fun trying to get the kibble out  what they fail to say is that the toy does not stay closed  if you twist too far  they cannot get anything out  if you open it a little more  it opens by itself and all the kibble tumbles out  game over     no further interaction  no play  no stimulation  nothing    this is just not worth it 
product	have been treating my dogs to these for years now   used to be able to buy them at petsmart   then walmart   now only on amazon com  they are the perfect size for treats and all of my dogs love them    the only downer is that shipping is free but very very slow    9 10 days seems the norm  this is the only place i can find these so next time i will just have to order far enough in advance that i do not run out   again  <br  >right now i have 3 sad faces staring at me   wondering where their treats are   <br  ><br  >update   my last two orders of these have arrived old  dried up and moldy   even had expired coupons in the bags  what a shame   they were my dogs  favorites and now i guess i will have to move on to something else  amazon did refund my full costs each time   
health	these treats can create a very serious problem  i just opened the new bag i bought from amazon and gave one to each of my three dogs and two of them got them stuck in their throats  both were choking and both had to have them pried out of their mouths by my husband and i  very scary  i have thrown them out  i do not recommend anyone buy these  based on their shape  size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky  they can choke your dog  do not buy these  period 
health	well  rats  i finally found a renal cat food that my cat likes  and they change the formula   to defend her pickiness  sabrina has had renal disease for 6 5 years  she is been through all the mainstream renal cat foods and sooner or later  tired of each of them  no going back  either  kitty with a memory   my luck  i read good reviews about hi tor neo diet early this year  and ordered a case  she scarfed that food down  things went along swimmingly until my last order >> hmm  new label  new size  new consistency  does not smell the same  for a week now  sabrina has consistently taken a few bites  then turns her nose up at it  she is eating maybe 1 8th of what she used to eat  i am shipping the remainder back  and the new search begins     sigh  anybody else having this experience 
product	i was immediately intrigued by this toy when i saw it as it clearly was designed similar to the   asin b0013hh2nm clix pyramid dog toy   but with the very nice addition of a removable top  so much easier to fill  i was excited to try it and see how well it worked <br  ><br  >unfortunately  what i did not realize from the photo was how close to the base that holds the food the hole is  you would think the food is all the way in the bottom but there is a shelf inside that it sits on and its not that far from the hole at all  it s at the bottom of the word kong when you look at the closeup photo   the hole itself is a bit larger as well  so if you have a small dog and are using fairly small kibble treats  more will come out at a time due to the larger hole size <br  ><br  >now  for a dog that is never used a puzzle toy like this  they will still take some time to figure it out  but my dog who has played with other puzzle toys very easily figured out how to empty this one in just minutes  the pyramid takes him 3 4 times as long due to the smaller hole and how high it is on the toy  <br  ><br  >so it depends on your needs  how fast a learner your dog is and how long you want him to spend with the toy  for mine  this is not really challenging enough  i love the ease of filling it  but really wish they had not put the hole so low 
quality	my kitty was getting around a little better after eating these treats for a few days but then she stopped eating them  maybe she will like them again later 
quality	as much as i had hoped this product would work for my chocolate lab beagle mix  it has not reduced the shedding  he also developed a bad smell from it after awhile  which decreased and ceased after i discontinued use  i used it for a number of months to give it a fair shake  but it just did not happen  i would have paid twice as much had it done the job  i do have a bottle left and may try it again later this year just because i really want wish it would work 
product	first of all  the description does not indicate that this toy is only appropriate for small dogs   as it says on the tag  it is so tiny and small  my eng  bulldog would swallow it whole if i gave it to him  it is very  very  very small and does not at all seem any more durable than a bouncy ball you would get out of a gumball machine  total waste of money 
product	i have two super strong chewers  and i generally really like planet dog toys  but i was very disappointed because this one only lasted a few hours  they almost immediately got the green \\ leaves\\  off of the top and began tearing the toy apart from the top down  definitely not worth the money 
product	i should have listened to the other one star reviewer  my antler was not like the picture  unfortunately  i too got half an antler   meaning it was half of a bisected piece  this exposes all of the marrow  gives your dog no challenge or time with the antler  and may cause an upset system   stomach for the dog  i will not buy this brand again 
product	i had used this product about 2 times before it broke  it has a top piece of fabric that closes to ensure that no treats fall out  this part actually tore away from the sides after my 2nd time using it for agility with my dog  now it is basically useless since it cannot hold treats in it without them falling out all over the place  i am a little disappointed 
quality	i am baffled by how big these treats are  it is as if there was a misunderstanding at the plant and someone thought they were being made for dogs  my male cat will not eat them unless they are cut into pieces  my female cat will not eat them at all  regardless of size 
product	we purchased the big bags thinking that we would save some money  but you end up paying much more because the shipping is too expensive  and if you think buying more bags you would get a better price nooo  they double or triple the shipping price  my cats love this meal but my pocket says that no no no  it is cheaper if you do a trip to walmart  ever though looks expensive  at the end is cheaper than ordering online 
product	i had previously purchased the lamb flavor of this brand of treats  it was very good quality and my dogs love it  also it was not greasy or too high in fat  that is not the case for the chicken flavored treats from this company  maybe it is a bad batch  but it is so oily i have to blot it with paper towel before letting my papillon have any and even then it upset her stomach  the package says it has 10  fat but i think it is much higher and would not recommend the chicken flavor 
health	i have a 5 year old female akita with chronic yeast infection in her left ear  i have been to the vet over the years and nothing seems to have worked  i came across this product and seen all the great reviews  i ordered the product and started using it  it looked like her ear was getting better with each and every use  i used it for 14 days and it looked like it cleared it up nicely  after about 2 days of not using the product the yeast infection was back plus she now had it in her right ear  she is never had any issues with that ear until now  after the first 14 days  i was so happy because it looked like the problem was solved  i nearly came here to give this product a positive review at that time  i am now wondering how many people are experiencing the same thing i am  how many people gave the product a good review only to have the problem come right back  
quality	my dogs go nuts for tripe  so i thought this would be an easy way to give them what they love in biscuit form  i was not impressed nor were they  it is not smelly and looks very wholesome with good fresh biscuit qualities  the problem is the only thing i could smell was parsley  there was no hint of tripe smell to it and that is what dogs love  my two spoiled fur buddies just sniffed and walked away  i will not order any more 
health	in february of 2010 i ordered a 14 oz canister of pro treat freeze dried chicken liver dog treats i had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat  they both loved these treats  when i opened my new pro treats freeze dried liver treats i smelled an odd odor  my cat would not eat these new treats  my dog did eat these treats but every morning he started throwing up  i stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick  the liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but i did not want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again 
product	this is not a sturdy product it lasted 5 minutes with my little dog what a total waste of money  stay away from this product
product	i have purchased antlers for my 8 month puppy before  she loves them  they usually take between one and three months before they get too small and i replace them  when i received this antler  it was cut in half lengthwise  i did not think this was a problem  it was  it allowed her to get to all the marrow on day one  the marrow was far too rich for her  it took two days for her system to get back together  also  after she got the marrow out  it was not as interesting  i will not buy this brand again 
product	my dogs love these and they seem like they are made out of quality ingredients from reading the package but it says in bold letters across the back  \\ must be refrigerated after opening\\   i do not know about you  but my dogs treats are kept in a certain area and they are not fed people food  therefore  i feel it is sending the wrong message to be opening the fridge and giving my dogs a treat out of it since now they stand by the fridge expectantly everytime i open it and they are aware that that is where the people food is kept  it is very inconvenient to have to keep these in the fridge so i will not be purchasing them again  also  the portion size is very small for the price 
health	this is the second time i bought these beef tendons  the first time they were fine   the shape was long  the way they are supposed to be  and they were easy for my dog to chew  but this last time  the shapes were bulky and awkward and resulted in my dog s choking on one of these irregular and strange shaped pieces that she tried to swallow and that got stuck in her throat  the choking episode went on for 15 minutes and ended only when she vomited her entire stomach contents  it was very frightening 
health	fit the dog chew toy well but made in china  i just have a problem with all the toxic stuff from china lately  do not like putting my dog in danger of another oops from china
quality	i hate that my finicky kitty will only eat this awful cat food  it is nothing but by products and fillers  i was feeding him natural balance turkey and giblets  but when i opened this last batch of cans i could see it was much looser and when my cat refused to eat it  i knew it changed  this is the only food i can get him to eat  i mix a small amount of it with some healthier dry food  that does not have any by products or fillers  so at least he is getting something decent to eat 
product	i was looking for a chicken duck dog treat that is not made in china  most of the popular ones state that they are on their packaging   this one  with its dual french english labeling and free range title  appeared to be a north american free range organic type natural product  especially given the price  but it is not  it is also made in china  upon closer inspection it says this product has no added hormones  antibiotics  preservatives    but it does not say the product is free of these additives  i feel duped  and i am returning  i can get the same china quality for half the price without being taken for a ride 
quality	unfortunately  despite the description and ingredients supposed to be enticing  like l aixe air    which my cat loves  he will not touch this stuff  very disappointing   i was hoping for the extra vitamin intake 
product	i have stocked our dogs  treat pantry with plato s farmers market products for about a year  my dogs love their salmon and salmon with vegetable treats  i recently purchased their sweet potato treats  which have a \\ best by\\  date of 9 22 10  shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white   blue mold  unacceptable   disgusting  the bag s sticker has \\ x00133d6p\\  on it  i have bought plato products many times previously and have been pleased  however  these are supposed to be safe and quality treats  i absolve the seller  the whole healthy pet  of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue  however  i do firmly assert that plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of sweet potato treats 
product	i bought this product along with the anti icky poo because i have an idiot orange tabby who has decided he has to mark his territory  inside  anyway   i have used other products and they advised you buy this product if other products had been used before so it would make the anti ickpoo product to work more effectively  uhm   not so much  in my opinion  i wound up destroying and or discarding what i tried to treat as it might last for a day or so  but the smell would keep coming back  and to me  worse than it had been before the treatment  granted  this was on an artificial christmas tree  and may have worked better on a carpet or whatever   but it sure did not help on upholstery  it is expensive  and they say you need to dilute it   really  it comes in a spray bottle  so now i have to go out and get another bottle to follow the instructions  full strength or diluted  not so much and i will not waste my money on any more of this product 
product	once i opened the package  there was a terrible smell resembling decay rotting fish that came from these  i tried to \\ air  them out to see if the smell would go away  only to have my next door neighbor tell me about a \\ dead animal smell\\  that she could smell all the way up from her 2nd floor apartment 300 feet away  sure enough  i brought her over to where these were \\ aerating\\  and it was the culprit   i guess the wind was blowing just right that day   i have purchased other products from this brand previously with no issues  but whatever this was  the smell was too awful to give to the dog 
product	gave this to my small dog and she downed it in about an hour  so much for everlasting  and it stank  i do not mean slight smell either  it stank up the whole living room  i will not buy this again 
product	i purchased these bones for my two bullmastiffs  i thought they were like the other bones previously purchased  but these were brittle and splintered  after paying the  880 vet bill for the bone fragments in my bullmastiff puppy s stomach  i threw them away  i would not recommend them at all  my male bullmastiff chewed threw 1 bone in about five minutes  an expensive lesson 
product	despite the name  these are not really cupcakes  they are just flat cookies  the sprinkles fall off pretty easily  so be careful to clean up after yourself  on the plus side  our dogs liked them 
quality	my dog was not interested in these treats  and we even bought the toy that you are supposed to stuff them in  i am not sure why he did not like them  but i have a whole bag that he turns his nose up to each time i offer them 
product	   the humans  not so much  we bought a few boxes for a petsitter s use  thinking that pouches would be more convenient than canned  in fact  we found them to be much less convenient  about a third of the time  the top tab does not tear all the way off as it should  thence getting in the way and dripping gravy all over the place  a significant portion of the food stays at the bottom of the pouch after dispensing  requiring scooping out with a spoon   also a messy endeavor  all flavors have lots of gravy  which the cats love  but makes me feel as though i am paying for a lot of water  we have happily switched back to trader joes  canned catfood  which the cats really like  is a good quality product  and is more reasonably priced   with the added advantage of having recyclable packaging 
health	three years ago we found out our dog bella had severe food allergies fish potatos veggies fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat  i look and could only find newmans own salmon potato treats for her to eat since then they come evey 2mths  by sub save  today when i opened the first package i was shocked  the normally heart shaped treats that are light  airy  thick  and easy to break were nothing but dark flat hard to break rocks  so my question is \\ what happened \\  not only was it one package but all six  if this is their new product they lost a customer but if it was a bad batch  i say how dare they send this out to consumers take their money and think its right today there are many treats made that she can eat but i stuck with newmans out of loyalty because they were first in making a great product bella could eat and bella really loves this treats i hope newmans can fix this 
product	i ordered greenies dental treats from entirely pets for my dog  the item was described as being a package of 40 treats and their mailing rate  what i received was 1 small bone that weighed at least 1 3 of the advertised weight  when i contacted customer service  the response i received was basically \\ oh well   there s nothing i can do about it \\  definitely not \\ customer service \\ 
product	i use these treats for a treat ball for my dogs  they are typically the perfect size and my dogs love them  the problem with this order was that the treats were all broken into tiny little pieces during the packing and or shipping process  making them virtually useless 
quality	my one cat loves liver   chicken and i have been buying fancy feast s liver   chicken but it is pretty costly  i tried my cat on friskies liver   chicken and he use to eat it but as of late has stopped eating this food with the same enthusiasm as he use to and seems to prefer the fancy feast 
product	this product was a total ripoff  i bought it based on customer reviews  and although the fleas did seem to go away for a day or two  they were back within a week  the second pill seemed to have no affect at all  i feel that i wasted my money on this product  advantix is still the best  and worth every penny 
quality	my dog does not like the toy that goes with these  the treats are ok  she loves the treats by themselves 
product	i use the salmon oil to maintain a healthy skin and coat on my dogs  i was disappointed that the pump did not work  would not open making it difficult to give the correct amount of the salmon oil 
product	we tried the nasty habit brand before  which seemed to work for our one dog with the problem  we bought that at petsmart and it was fairly expensive for a small amount  we tried this brand hoping it would do the same job for less per tablet  unfortunately  it did not seem to help at all  also  with it containing alot of msg  we are hesitant to up the dosage too much 
product	i was very disappointed in the quality if the ingredients   our dog was only mildly interested  will definitely not order these again 
product	i tried this pricey dog food for my australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs  first of all  making a decision on what food to buy is confusing  they have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting  with the help of a sales clerk i picked the medium breed adult  my dog  at first did like the food very much but i felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food i had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it  the ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils  certainly this was not worth the price tag 
product	delivered fast but a little more pricey then i would have liked to spend  i usually can get them from the home website for 8 00 a bag  but they were out of them
quality	i tested this product out on 3 different cats  i guess the aroma appealed to them because they tried to eat it  but not one of them was able to the pieces are just too large  i think they are too hard as well 
health	my rabbit loved eating this in the way that people probably love eating funnel cake    not a good idea  i have read more and more articles since then about how some of the very ingredients in treat sticks like this are unhealthy  indigestible and potentially life threatening to rabbits  ingredients such as certain seeds and corn   the biggest discovery was when i was reading the side of the package and it was talking about where to hang it in your  bird s  cage  do not get me wrong  i have purchased some great kaytee products for my little guy  but seriously    protect your rabbit and buy something else 
quality	my first hint that i might not be re ordering was the caution on the package to \\ wash hands with soap and water\\  after handling the treats  i have never seen that before  hmm  the things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side show of the treat world  they smell strange  and look like butcher store offal  i understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals  but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as \\ food \\  there were some bits  unidentifiable  that the dog would not eat  though she would eat most of them  she does not seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat  though  and i do not like carrying a few in my pocket on walks  because some are great big tube like things and some are tiny stick pieces  and of course then i spend the whole walk wanting to wash my hands  it is just a strange  creepy assortment  and i do not think i will be getting this product again 
product	these are moist treats and my 3 cats all love them which is rare  they are hard to find in my city so i thought i would order them through amazon  i was a little concerned about ordering a 7 pack but i figured that we would go through them relatively quickly  i was so disappointed to find when my pack arrived on 12 31 08 that the  best by  stamp date was 8 18 08  this was my first time ordering a grocery item and unless this is resolved to my satisfaction  i am not going to order online again  so the final word is  pick these up locally to see if your cats like them 
product	i do not know what others got  but i was shipped a box of teeny tiny little pig ears in a box that said they were a product of spain  all 100  if that is how many are even in there  of them were inside a plastic bag about the size of a potato chip bag inside the box  you could have fit several of those bags in the box  but i got only one  it would take 4 of these pig ears to equal the size of just one that i can buy from my local pet food store for about  1 00 a piece  that is no exaggeration  to help you visualize this  the average size pig ear is smaller than my computer mouse  and i have a typical mouse  all i can say is do not make the mistake i made  after reading the other reviews i thought this would be a quality product  well  while it appears that it was at one time  it certainly is not anymore  i weighed the bag and it was a bit over 4 pounds  i paid  80 after shipping  that means i paid roughly  20 per pound for this junk  and since these do not come from the united states  there is no telling if they are even safe for my dogs to eat  what a complete rip off    edit  check the \\ customer images\\  of this product  i uploaded two photos that show the average sized pig ear 
quality	i like dogswell products and have purchased the \\ vitality\\  chicken chews before  which are actually chewy   but these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock  i seriously could not even chew them  it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker   way too hard  my dog and my roomie s dog did not care for them one bit  i purchased them because they were on sale  deeply discounted  and now i know why     buy other dogswell chews  just not these sweet potato ones   
product	i got these and opened a package quickly giving some to my cat only to notice they were moldy  noticed package expiration date has passed some time ago  cat was mad when i took them back from her  i suppose these would be pretty good if not spoiled 
product	i decided to give these a try after looking at the other reviews  and sadly disappointed with these treats  my dogs breath is horrible and she is having severe digestion problems after eating a few of these  i am going back to the petrodex dental chews 
product	fyi  there are two flavors of rawhide in each package  my puppy only likes one of them so the other half of the package is useless  i wish these rings came in other flavors like chicken  liver  salmon etc 
product	i did not realize these bones were so thin  i had assumed they were chew bones  but instead were actually a treat  if you are looking for something to occupy your dog for an hour  these are not it  my 11 week old puppy chainsawed through one in no time  i really needed something to keep him chewing for a while  something that was not my couch or shoes  i will keep looking   
quality	we constantly search for the right treats  no arsenic laden rawhides for our girl  but what to give her  at only 15 pounds  she is half beagle  so she fits into a power chewer category  we loved this bag of bully bites  and so does she  she gets to pick one out every nite   it is her bedtime \\ chewie\\     but sometimes we have to counteract it is \\ fragrance\\  with a little room deodorizer  just opening the bag will produce a pretty pungent smell  which of course  the dog loves    it is just a but harsh on human noses    <br  >still better than rawhides  100  protein  no wheat  no corn  no fillers  just little bites of baked bullwinkles    i guess if you are a dog  it would be heavenly    
quality	my dog would not eat these bones  nor would my cats  they were so tiny  maybe the size of a treat for a hamster or guinea pig  and way too expensive 
product	i have used advantage in the past on my cats and it has always worked effectively  this time  it did absolutely nothing to rid the problem  this product was a total waste of money and time 
health	meow mix \\ turkey\\  variety  like their fillet meow \\ beef\\  flavor  turns out to have a large portion of tuna  which makes my cat sick  if your cat is sensitive to tuna  steer clear 
quality	this is probably just my dog and not the product  i have a chinese crested who does not like the feel of the litter on his feet  he does seem to have sensitive feet  though  he is using the litter box for a nap with a blanket in it 
quality	i have a 20 year old male that is a very good eater  he has been on seed pellet mixes his whole life and eats any kind of table food  this mix  while very clean and fresh looking  has alot of small seed  millet and other  that my bird will not touch  with the exception of the nuts and dried fruit chunks  it looks like a cockatiel mix  he is wasting probably 25  or more  the price on amazon was the best i found and it is a nice mix   but not for birds that do not care for small seeds 
product	2 6 2013 these are made in china  which have been found to cause liver damage <br  ><br  >they are great as treats  the only thing that i thought was kinda weird was the fact that there seems to be some kind of red coloring or something  at first i thought my dog s gums were bleeding or something but it seems that its just a part of the product  otherwise  he goes crazy for them so i am glad i got these 
quality	the ingredients are all good  but my yorkie will only play with these treats    not eat them  buy newman s chicken treats instead 
quality	we tried it on our dog  but she would still eat her stool after a few weeks on the tablets  even doubling the amount did not help  <br  >all by herself she stopped eating her stools  long after we stopped giving her the tablets  <br  >maybe your an experience with your dog would be different 
quality	my cats would not touch these  so was a waste of money  gave most of the packages to other people who is cats are not as picky  will not be buying them again  <br  > <br  >
quality	i used to just feed this only to my colony cats because it is cheap  my indoor cats get the healthy stuff that only has good ingredients  recently  one of my elder cats stopped eating  after a few days of trying everything i could think of  i gave him some of this in small portions  and he gobbled it up  within a short time he was back to himself and eating healthy food again  in this case  it was a life saver 
quality	you were out of the cat chow i usually give my outdoor cats who are kind of feral  they turned their noses up at the meow mix so i had to go to target for cat chow  the good new is that the big and baby raccoons seem to love it  providing much pleasure watching their antics 
quality	my husband bought a small bag of dry food in an orange bag while i was away  thought this was it but cats really do not care for this 
quality	bought meow mix 40 plus years  now there is so much crumbs {can t think of another word to describe it} that i have to put it through a colander before it goes in the bowl  it really is a mess and the cats do not like it this way  too much is being wasted 
health	i have 8 cats because of fostering  they all seem to like the food but i am seeing them vomit  they do not vomit each time they eat but i cleaned up barely digested food in 4 places again this morning about 20 minutes after they ate  i am going to buy a different brand today and see for sure that it is not something else 
quality	cat loved the turkey and chicken  but did not love the beef  he would not eat it 
quality	a cat food that is nearly all liquid appeals to the cats once in a while but they will not eat it on a regular basis as more substantial appeal to them more  i will not ever buy this large a quantity of this one again 
product	i am an avid chewy supporter  this has nothing to do with the product   i have ordered chewy for many years now and  specifically  this summer has been financially hard for many different reasons  every time my autoship is coming up  which i’m thankful for the email that warns me   i review what’s on my order and determine if i am getting the best deals  i am a teacher and every dollar counts  as of my last two orders  the first one i called about and it was handled wonderfully and i am so grateful  however  it happened again this last order and i’m become frustrated  the price of this product when up by close to  5 right before the autoship was confirmed  i checked the status just the
quality	my cat would not eat this food  either would my friends cat 
quality	my indoor and outdoor cats used to love fancy feast grilled and fancy feast gravy lovers  in the last 2 3 years  they no longer will eat most of the varieties in these cat food lines  all five cats will lick up the gravy and not touch a bite of the meat  purina is broadening their cat food offerings at the expense of fancy feast gravy lovers 
product	my cat did not enjoyed bits a food but enjoyed the gravy he pretty much slap the bowl around i am not saying this is for every cat but my cat just did not like it 
quality	one would not touch any of it  barely even smelling what was there and went hungry rather than try it  and my other cat licked the gravy but did not touch the food part 
quality	my cats will not eat this gravy stuff  some might  mine won t 
quality	i got these because our cat seemed to be tiring of the ocean whitefish version we would been getting her for a while  but she turns her nose up at the beef and chicken and just sort of picks at the turkey  i guess she really prefers fish  we will have to find some other fish flavors to try  i like the idea of a variety pack though 
quality	my cats would not eat any of these so i gave it to the strays i feed  but even they barely touched it 
quality	there rest of the order was perfect except for this one box  i will replace it with another on my next order  we do not eat beef either  very interesting  right 
quality	the gravy lovers line is higher in carbs and fillers than the classic pate line  stick to the classic pate line if you are trying to optimize your cat s diet  but hey  if your cat loves gravy and will not eat much else  this is not a terrible choice  btw  if your cat loves gravy  there are products out there made of dehydrated beef liver that make a good nutritious gravy  so try experimenting with those too 
health	i threw away two cans in the varietyb pack  as i feel they could have been unhealthy for my cats 
quality	i have a small settlement of cats that i feed in fire island  they love it  my indoor cats will not touch it go figure 
product	my two persians gave it a couple of licks  but definitely are not a fan in general of beef  however  i thought i would give it a try       predominantly they like the classic pate recipes  this gravy lovers is overwhelmingly gravy with tiny bits of meat or poultry  this recipes was 90  ignored by my two kitties  however  this is not to say that other cats would likewise not enjoy this recipe  cats vary  just like humans 
quality	i have been buying this brand of food for years without issue from other stores  my cat will not touch this bag of dust  bye chewy 
health	we ordered 2 bags   one had a hole at the bottom corner  after opening it we notice little black bugs at the area of the bag inside where the hole came through  we tossed the bag so the rest of the food would not be infested 
product	chewy is so no brainer  try them out and you will not be disappointed 
product	i was looking for a small kibble to replace my other more expensive food and this seemed to fit the bill  i did not even have to mix the two  they went from one right to the other and cleaned it all up  will be re ordering in a bigger bag next time 
product	i use this chow as a filler for my 5 cats  because their no grain dry food is so expensive 
quality	this was really what i ordered but when trixie did not eat at first i thought bummer but she is eating now
quality	go to recall on purina cat chow indoor and find out for yourself 
quality	sorry my cats do not like this so i will not be purchasing it again 
product	was disappointed in the product it has too much gravy and not enough meat 
quality	she cannot get enough of this canned food  my girl  unfortunately  has underdeveloped teeth  so soft food is her main option  she is always super excited for food and looks forward to it every time  never turns her nose away  reason i gave it 3 5 is because it does contain corn meal gluten in it  i only bought the food because it was what my kitty was given at the rescue  but a lot of the ingredients are a bit questionable  i plan on trying out other soft foods that are grain free and have more protein for her too 
quality	the older my 2 cats the finicky eaters they become  i never know what they will or will not eat  however i have met with some success with this product 
quality	this is good food for cats  recommended by your staff  but my cat does not like any flavor unfortunately 
quality	unfortunately my finicky cat will not eat it so i will be donating the 22 cans i have left to the humane society  silly cat 
health	she at half a can in the beginning  but she does not touch this at all after  she loves can food  but this is my first time seeing her not eating  i tried giving it to her for few days  but she just leaves it and it all dries up  she lost weight after not eating   it really depends on your pet s preference  in my case  i will not buy this again 
quality	my cats love seafood  but the chunks in the grilled varieties are often too big  i find i have to cut them up and sometimes they are still not eaten  i would recommend the classic varieties over the grilled ones 
product	the food is made up of things i do not really want to feed my cat gluten  corn  wheat and things but the price is right  so i mix it with avoderm  avoderm is good stuff but very expensive  chewy com is a great and wonderful sevice 
product	the past two months of deliveries i’ve got them on two different days which was very disappointing i’ve stop my auto shipment because you could not seem to deliver everything at the same time which was very frustrating and i had to go out and replace some food before the other box got here
product	i received this item a couple of days ago  the chewy box was in great condition  however the friskies box was quite dented and beat up  when i opened the box  several of the cat food cans were dented 
quality	my cat likes the taste but will not eat it unless i break it up
product	i ordered  2  cases of canned friskies cat food  while i was happy with the prompt delivery  i was very perturbed that one case was full of dented cans and labels that were peeling away from the cans  hanging like tags  pretty crappy if you ask me  not sure about future deliveries 
quality	my cats will not eat this product  they are barn cats  and prefer shreds  i marked it a 3 because i am neutral on it  indoor cats might like it 
quality	sometimes my cat changes her mind about what she likes  last time i bought this she loved it  now she does not care for pate  no idea why but she is a high maintenance cat who has decided she wants the dogs  food or shreds  i think she does not like the texture of pate as she has turned up her nose at other pate style cat foods 
quality	my cats love the friskies pate  so i thought i would try the variety pack  there is this one flavor in this pack  it is the grilled meat  it is in the gold cans  none of them will eat that flavor at all  i wish i could return it  but it was part of the package  i will know better next time  i had to give you only 2 stars because i am stuck with this product they will not touch 
quality	i bought this instead of my usual because chewy did not offer my usual  i wish i didn t  my kitty was not interested in eating it so i checked it out further and it had gross looking chunks of non food looking stuff  but it was in every one on every kind  so it was normal 
product	the friskies box was open and the cans of cat food were spilled out  some of them were dented 
product	the cans were either split open or wormy very disapointed with the product  will have to return the product for refund 
product	guess i was not paying attention and ordered instead of the brand my cats usually eat  they do not really care for it much  not my first choice for quality or nutrition  they just get a little spoonful with their dry so hopefully can use it up  if not  shelter woul probably love to have it 
product	this is the only wet food my cats will eat  i am giving this a poor rating because at least 2 of the 24 cans were dented in every case i have ordered through chewy 
quality	i guess its tried and true  thank goodness we do not see friskies recalls  my pets as well as the outdoor ones do not like most of the flavors  but there still are a few that they do once in awhile 
product	this item arrived with most of the cans dented  some so bad i could not open the tab tops 
quality	my cat do not like it at all i tried to get them to eat twice n they would not not i got s 12 pack of food my cats do not like     
quality	my cat does not like any of the canned food i meant to order fancy feast canned foods
quality	i should never buy a case of fancy feast because it seems every time i do  my cats will not eat it  i put it in front of them  they smell it and walk away even though they are hungry  i think it is the plant where it is produced  but i cannot prove that  when i buy locally and individually  i check the numbers on the bottom of the cans and i cannot do that at chewy  it is not chewy s fault  they cannot be expected to know which plants produce bad food 
quality	my previous cats loved fancy feast  but my new kittens will not eat  they take a couple bites then walk away  also the smaller one ate some  then i noticed she had watery stool 
product	to my surprise  one of the cans of fancy feast was leaking when i open the carton  i found a second can in the carton dented  all else seemed ok 
product	neither of my cats will eat this it was a waste of money
quality	arrived in great condition  but cats will not eat it  they eat another flavor  the fish  but will not touch this and the other non fish flavor  not sure why  they are not usually picky 
product	the only food out of this expensive case of fancy feast classic pate that my three cats would eat was turkey and giblets classic   they actually love that but wont eat the other    very disappointing as i was hoping to be  stocked up  on cat food but now i am almost out of the good  healthy stuff 
quality	these were some others that my cats walked away from  they would go back if nothing else was put down for them  more often than not  all 4 bowls would still have food in them when the next round came 
health	this food is like giving your cat mcdonalds  yes  it is cheap  yes  all cats love it but it is super unhealthy
quality	cat will not eat it  had to give rest to a friend  ok
product	my cats love this and this flavor was cheaper than walmart  however the fish and shrimp is more expensive than walmart     at walmart the prices are the same no matter what flavor    product 5 starts   pricing 3 stars
quality	sorry  but my cat really does not like this food  he smells it  then takes a few bites and walks away  i end up giving these to stray cats when i can  and mix with hard dry food 
quality	please bring back the old formula  my cat will not eat this new crap  this one does not contain cheese
quality	these new flavors are not met with satisfaction by my two cats  they loved the original flavors  but will not eat any of new flavors  now i have to hunt for something else that they will eat  which is not easy 
product	my cats like the tasty treasures with cheese  now it seems they will not be available  at least all the ones they were eating  frustrated    
quality	this is a real problem  and it is good to see it is not just me  the change to the chicken tastytreasures results in a cabinet full of cat food that the cats simply will not eat  as opposed to something they used to devour to the point that the dishes looked unused  and i do not find any notice of the change   so i ordered what i usually do  and ended up with a useless bunch of cat food  i have no idea what to do now  since i am told that it pretty much changed across the board   would have been nice to say so  first disappointment ever from chewy 
product	i also received an order from chewy that was supposed to be tasty treasures with cheese  instead i received tasty treasures with scallops so i checked the different kinds of tasty treasures on chewy and found none that contained cheese  i contacted purina and was informed that they replaced the cheese with scallops in july 2019 i was very disappointed because my cats all loved the recipe with cheese and just sniff and walk away from the new formula with scallops  please let purina know if this disappoints you too and perhaps they will bring the cheese back for our finicky felines 
quality	my 4 cats and my 6 strays will not eat this anymore  they changed the original formula that had cheese  that is the one they like  i will not buy this anymore until they hopefully change it back  not chewy s fault though  we love chewy    
quality	my cats hate this “ new and improved”  i had the original on auto ship and last shipment i got this stuff instead  all my cats turned their noses up to this  even the feral cats won’t eat this stuff  what a waste of    bring the original with the chees back     
quality	we’ve been buying this tasty treasures wet food with cheese for our 3 cats for months and they absolutely loved it   they wouldn’t eat anything other than this  our autoship came this time and they hate the new formula  they used to clean their plates and now they turn their nose up to it and will barely touch it  very very disappointed   
product	usually everything arrives in good condition  it seemed to me one of the boxes of friskies cans was a damaged box  the cans were dented  not all cans but most
quality	i have been buying this variety pack for awhile and with 2 cats who have different tastes it was doing fine i have a very fussy tuxie who turns her nose up at almost all i feed her  this time when i got it i noticed a change  they added liver and scallop flavors and it looked completely different the fish one was the only one my tuxie would eat my big boy had no issue with the change and loves them all  nothing else wrong with this friskies variety and i do recommend it  but i thought i would mention the change in case other cat parents have fur babies that may not like the added liver and scallop flavors 
product	this food is my cats favorite  i bought 2 cases of canned food  both cases the cans are all dented 
product	my kitten loves this food but i was disappointed that it arrived with all cans dented and one broke opened  what a mess 
quality	i ordered this by mistake  i strongly prefer pate because it plops out of the can with a few shakes  this is not pate  the cats like it well enough  so in fairness i have to say that  for those who do not hate scraping stinky ooey gooey cat food out of the can with a spatula or spoon  it is a nice product  for that reason  i gave it three stars instead of one  as far as i am concerned  cat food in gravy is a pain and i can hardly wait to use it up  in the future  i will read the text more carefully 
quality	none of our 7 cats will eat this with the big chunks of something similar to cold meat or bologna  we smash it with a fork and they still do not like it  from what i have read concerning feline diets  most do not like big pieces of anything and especially when it is of this texture  i do not recommend this food  so much goes to waste
product	i got these because my cats  4 of them  like the gravy and cheese it the product  but when i opened the box  some of the cans were damaged  some bent up and mishandled  now i cannot always blame chew for this  sometimes you got to lay the blame in the postal service  it is just my cats wont eat out of a can that has been dented or cracked open  i guess they can smell that it is bad and they try to cover it like it was laying in the cat litter box  from now on i will stick to the other can foods i ordered before  they seem to get here undamaged 
product	if you are looking for a box of tasty treasure only  do not buy this box  it has eight cans of pate in it 
quality	the food is great  my toby is spoilt though   will not eat the pate  gravy only  if i would have read the description better i would have known  my bad  i have changed the next autoship though to all gravy 
quality	my cat will not eat it he prefers 9lives so not sure what to do with all the cans lol i had to go to the store and buy him the other 9 lives kind  other than that shipping and buying experience was very easy and quick  will shop again thank you
product	there was 5 damaged cans in this pack and the other pack of 24 we got  i like the idea of door delivery 
quality	i buy the  treasures  because they are all shreds with gravy  this package contains 6 cans of pate  which my cat will not eat  probably should have read the fine print 
quality	i guess i have four very finicky cats but they did not care for this variety pack  they typically like fish and chicken based food but not this collection 
quality	i ordered this and the turkey cans are pate not chunks  the description is wrong  very upset  cats will not eat 
quality	i will no longer be having this item autoshipped  i read all through the write up and never once saw that there was pate included  i do not like using pate food for my cat 
product	i order large shipments of cat food when i locate the food on sale through several online sites  i do not save any money  when several cans are defective  i usually do not discover this problem until i open the case many days or weeks after my order arrives  unfortunately  this peticular order had several open  dented cans of food  the defect was only discovered after the odor and maggots were observed upon opening the cases  i realize that chewy did not intend for this to happen and it was no doubt caused by the product being handled roughly during shipping   not my fault   however by trying to save a few pennies per can  it would be cheaper to buy elsewhere when this unfortunate issue happens
health	good for strays  but noticed one cat threw up after eating 
health	i purchased thinking my cats would like it but i’ve noticed they throw up often  not the regular hair balls they would throw up  but actual huge chunks of food so i know this is what causes it  switching back to their original food 
health	i do not rate this item highly because there are better quality cat foods available  and i would not recommend this food to other cat owners  however  i buy it because my cat likes it  he is over 10 years old and has no health problems  so i am not going to try to fix what is not broke 
product	they do not love it or eat it consistently  strange cats who were once feral loce chewy delivery 
quality	my fur babies r very picky  they refused to eat this  i wanted to try something different but they didn’t agree with me 
product	just started this to help our older kitties avoid utis  hope it works  cannot really rate right now pretty expensive so hope it helps 
quality	my cats have been eating royal canin urinary so for years and loved it until now  royal canin reformulated the recipe and now my cats refuse to eat it  when i reached out to royal canin they said that their veterinarian nutritionist think there was enough change in the recipe to warrant an adjustment period for the cats  boy were they wrong 
product	this product came with the bag damage there was a big slice in the middle of the bag and when i picked it up out of the box that it was delivered in cat food went everywhere in my living room i had to try and sweep it up with a dustpan and save it because this special diet food is so expensive i could not afford to waste any it seemed as if the bag had been sliced open maybe buy a razor blade like a box cutter or something like that i understand it happens but it is very inconvenient when it happens on your living room
quality	unfortunately my cat had surgery in september due to stones so she was put on a special urinary food  i have tried this bag by royal canin and purina s ur food but my cat seems to be allergic to both  so now i have a bunch of food she cannot eat  her previous diet did not have grains and so many fillers like the rx foods which i believe is the cause  i am afraid to take her off the prescription diet in fear of possible relapse but i am running out of options  my vet does not have any recommendations  i have asked her to look into diet options 
product	my dog hated the dry version of this food and would pick out the kibble  so i ground it up and mix it in with some hamburger and wet royal canin  i do not really know what rating to give this food  but i would suggest buying a small bag first to see if your pet will eat it 
product	the fast delivery was great    i just broke open the bag  too early to tell  but my boys seem to be eating it ok  more later 
product	expensive  even with auto ship it is slightly cheaper at my vet  there is no reason that this needs to be prescription since all my cats must eat this because one cat needs it 
product	one of my cats was on this a few years ago after a  700 vet visit and tests   discovering a urinary blockage  the blockage cleared and surgery was avoided  i have three cats  so all the cats were on it  after a while  because of cost and the ingredients in this food  i went back to my former dry food  oh  they do share a can of fancy feast wet food in the morning  so a few years went by and recently i noticed that same cat was having urinary issues again  i immediately bought this food for all the cats  the urinary issue blockage resolved without another  700 vet visit  now i am torn  this is expensive and not the most nutritious  currently  i alternate this food with their other food  yes  they
quality	but if your cat has had issues and likes it i am sure it will help    but my cat does not care for it and when i look at the ingredients i do not see a big difference from his regular dry food except for the high salt content  i am mixing it with his old dry food and he is eating it but not very fast 
quality	my cats wont eat it  they are just walking away after smelling it  i even tried putting beef broth on it but they lick off the broth   do not touch the food
quality	this food was donater to a shelter   my cats would not eat it      i have 3 cats  it smelled awful and i will not order again  all the other items were great  thank you
quality	i was saddened to discover that this particular order had almost all of its cans dented  several i had to throw away because the contents were discolored 
quality	boo loved the grilled but does not like this one  may i return the unused cans for the grilled  he is just picky i guess 
quality	i had been ordering sheba but decided to change  sorry i did as my cat does not like this food
quality	i thought i was ordering a different product  my cat will not eat this 
quality	my cat prefers cat food with gravy  she turns her nose up to pate 
quality	my cats eat fancy feast gravy lovers and would not touch this fancy feast classic 
quality	this past order  i have found that the cat wet food appears old  dried out  very disappointed  not sure if i will be ordering again from you all 
quality	i have a couple of older cats  they are finicky  they do not eat this very well  sometimes they nibble  then walk away 
product	i have been ordering cat litter from chewy com for quite some time now and have never had any issues  always good prices and quick delivery  however  i recently ordered a 32 pack of friskies canned pate and after a few days i started smelling something like a dead animal  i thought it was possibly my ball python had passed away  come to find out it was the cat food that i ordered  i assume during shipping several of the cans were damaged and the seals was broken  there were hundreds of maggots everywhere and i had to throw all of the cans in the trash  it was disgusting 
product	my cat eats half a can of fish flavored friskies twice a day  however  most all of the cans came flat on one or more sides  since my cat only eats half a can at a time  we use plastic lids to keep them fresh  the lids will not fit on smashed cans  i will pay three cent more per can to get undamaged cans 
product	i have been buying this brand for my feral kitties for about a year and this time the cans arrives damaged and several of the cans were bad   the food was rancid  i was pretty surprised but had to throw out half a case of it  otherwise the kitties have loved it 
quality	i got 3 cases of this flavor grouping   thought they would love it like the others  but they don t  i have tossed out more than they have eaten lately so i will have to find another flavor to get next order  it cannot have any cheese cause they do not like the cheese variety too  looking for a rescue to hand off the 2 cases of 32 cans i have left  hopefully i can find something else 
product	i received my boxed of canned food and when i opened it up several cans were dented and had food residue on the outside  not sure if this happened in transport but was scared to feed any open cans of food to my cats 
product	friskies makes a quality product  the price is good and free shipping  there should be more padding in the box to protect the cans from damage 
product	same as i get in local store  a little less expensive  the big thing was that it arrived sooner than i expected
product	the service overall was fine and definitely convenient  but the case must have been knocked around and the corner cans were dented  so the savings is a waste because i won’t feed dented cans to my cats  the loose cases were more secure and no damage to them 
health	i cannot attest to the flavor of this food but i buy it for the feral cats and they approve of three out of four flavors  something about the mariner s catch does not stink right most of them so they turn their noses up at it  what does not get eaten ends up being food for ants and bluejays if i do not grab it quick enough  the mariner needs to find a new job  clearly  otherwise it is good food for the feral cats  they eat it and leave the birds alone   all is balanced and this little spot of the world is harmonic 
quality	my cat has been on this for about 6 years  and will not touch it since the formula changed  i also want to add that it is very concerning when a 15 year old cat suddenly stops eating  so this had us very worried  i would have thought that such a major change on a product would have required some notification  very curious about how wide spread this issue is for other cat moms out there 
quality	harry was diagnoses with crystals after a full blockage and prescribed this food by his vet  what a waste of  50  as he will not eat it  awesome 
quality	cats loved it until it changed from  in gel  to  loaf   smells awful  consistency is different  cats will not eat it now  you cannot just change the ingredients in a cat s diet  especially one with urinary issues who needs all the moisture it can get  you would think spending 2x as much on a prescription diet would ensure food quality and consistency  but apparently not  would give 0 stars if i could 
product	like the others  i immediately noticed the formula is different  my cat is eating it but he is not enjoying it  it is more rubbery  drier  and smells different  i need more moisture in his diet  not less  not sure what i’m going to do yet 
health	my kitty is no longer doing well with this food  he keeps vomiting  i noticed that the label changed and the food looked different  i was thinking maybe i received the wrong product  so i was able to get a old green label can and compare to the new gold label can and see that many ingredients have changed  for example  corn flour is now wheat and it had chicken liver which is now pork  it is much dryer and has a rubber texture in which the fat separates  i pour hot water in to melt it and mix it in as the water content appears to be somewhat lower  the expiration on the cans are both 2021  but a four month difference  i really do not want to  but i am going to look into switching
quality	the quality appears good  unfortunately  the cat refuses to eat it 
quality	after my cat had to be sent to the er for urinary crystals  the vet recommended this and hills prescription food  i tried both and royal canin did not make it past the first week  both my cats would not touch this food  it is a gross paste and i felt bad even giving it to them  there are not much flavor options in this prescription brand so if your cat is having urinary issues  i would recommend hills  it is a little cheaper too 
health	i am sure this food is fantastic and everything  but i might never know because my cats will not eat it  recently put my cats on the so diet because of urinary tract issues  but my cats refuse to eat it  they love any other canned food  because they have never had wet food  but they will not eat this  it is a shame  because i was hoping this would really help them 
quality	unfortunately  both the moderate calorie and the regular urinary so wet food my cat does not like  honestly  i think if i were a cat  i would not like it  either  the smell of it is strong and it smells horrible  it stunk up my kitchen bad  i would think it equates to a not so great taste  she was eating this at first  but not very much  and now  she will not eat it at all  but she loves the dry food  go figure   it has a more pleasant smell  luckily  chewy is awesome  and refunded my money for the case i just bought and i get to donate it to a pet shelter to help other cats  chewy is an awesome company and has the best customer service 
quality	they like the dry version but will not touch the wet 
quality	he does not like it  i have a case of it on the recommendation of his vet after a blockage issue but i have to mix it with his regular canned to get him to eat it  if your cat likes it i am sure it is good for him but if he will not eat it it cannot help 
quality	one of our three boys had an issue with bladder stones and the other two had other flutd issues  struvites   high ph   we ordered several different foods to combat the problems including royal canin so chicken  we also wanted to give them a variety of flavors and protein sources  despite a good ingredient list all three ate this variety of food one time and then walked away every time after when we fed it to them  despite the good ingredients and excellent reviews  if they will not eat it then it does them no good  three stars for the ingredients  and with all the other excellent reviews i would recommend it but we will not reorder because our cats simply will not eat it 
health	one of my cats  who is in need of this food  will not eat it  what is bad about all prescription food   you cannot buy it in smaller quantities to try  so you end up with boxes of it  my other cat  who is not in need of this type of food  got sick  because he wanted to eat it  do not know what to do 
quality	main ingredient is pork by products  not chicken like i was told  no wonder my cat does not like it 
quality	my 2 cats will not eat this unless i mix it with hills c d 
quality	my cat had a series of partial blockages which ended with p u surgery  even after the surgery  he had recurring cystitis flare ups and struvite crystals  he has been on rc s o for 6 weeks and i am happy to say has being doing really well  i do mix in a small amount of a food he likes to make it more palatable  otherwise he will not eat it  i also question some of the ingredients  by products  corn and powdered cellulose  which i would rather not be feeding him  but overall  it has been a huge relief to have his flutd issues resolved  chewy is a great company to deal with great customer service and they really care about animals 
quality	my cat will not eat this  i purchased a whole case and cannot coax him to eat this product  also  initially tried another brand which he would not eat  would think the manufacturers could make these foods more palatable 
product	not so natural  not healthy  package suggests  reproduction   i spend my life and earnings saving what has been produced  but all the cats  wild racoons and opossum love it  and it is priced in line to feed many 
product	i have been a customer or over 2 years and am pleased with selection  prices quality and delivery  i have purchased a number of products and have been pleased with all  our cats like the frisco cat litter and use it all the time
quality	my fur kids do not like this   back to cat chow complete
health	i would like to begin by saying that chewy did refund me for the bags i received  without any problem  we still had a 1 2 bag of this food that we had purchased from kroger when this was delivered  we found the food to be more orange in color and the pellets  the bag itself  lighter in weight  it was curious to us  though we used it anyway  by that evening  3 of my 5 cats had thrown up  we ordered 3 bags  so i opened a 2nd one and unfortunately they got sick from that one also  the rachael ray dog food i ordered looks   feels exactly as the bag we had previously purchased from kroger  this is very unfortunate  as i truly enjoyed the convenience   price of ordering thru chewy  i have not
quality	my cats eat this because they refuse to eat anything else  i have spent untold      on other hard kibble and wound up giving it to friends or feeding it to my outdoor kitties 
quality	we donated the box to our neighbor  krishna did not eat any selection 
product	my cats love the shreds  however  the packaging is very flimsy resulting in at least 3 cans per box being squished and therefor open  spilling juice over the rest of the cans  it is for one a big mess and secondly i have to throw out those open cans  so  may i suggest to package the shreds in sturdier boxes  so that the damage can be minimized
product	my cats do not really seem to like it and it is pretty messy  i thought the variety would appeal to them  but guess that may be a human trait 
product	my friskies order arrived promptly  i happened to open one case right away and found a damaged can inside  although the case was undamaged  so this case must have been reconstructed from other damaged cases and a damaged can got into my case  no one wants damaged cans 
quality	i order two cases thinking my feline friend would be happy no matter what wet food  was i wrong  i did not realize i ordered patté instead of grilled and she will not eat it   so now i have to donate it to a shelter  i want to say a waste of money but at least someone will use it
product	put in an order that was in excess of  100 this was my first order with chewy and we were excited about it  when the order arrived the dry food was fine and other idem were ok but all the cans of cat food were dented 3 cases of cat food that were not good may not order again
product	the product was fine  but two of the cans were dented 
quality	either my cat is really finicky  or this food is not the best  he would not touch the food  he threw a fit until he got his regular canned food 
quality	cat does not like it  had to give to a friend  ok  
quality	i tried this because of the bogo sale and my kitty does not like it very much and does not want it eat it     it might be good for other cats  but not my picky kitty 
health	i cannot believe chewy would put all these harmful ingredients in the food  their canned line of american journey is about 95  good but this dry line is awful  i keep looking at it hoping something changed but it hasn t  sorry chewy try again and leave out all the peas and meals and you might have a product i would give to my pets 
quality	i got a buy one get one special for first purchase with high hopes  unfortunately my 5 cats do not like it at all  i have tried not giving them anything else to see if they will eat it but not one will bite  in fairness though  they have never had a grain free food  maybe if your cat is used to it they might like it  i guess i will have to donate the unopened bag and give the other out to the homeless cats across the street 
quality	know of my cats would it  known of the stray cats would eat it  and most of all my chickens would not eat it and they eat everything 
quality	my cats  that typically devour any food in sight have turned their noses up to this repeatedly  i even mixed it with canned wet food and they still would not touch it  obviously your mileage may vary  but it is not for this house 
product	smells a great deal  size okay  would not buy again  rather experiment than buy this 
product	i am pretty disappointed  my cat nibbles a bit at this food because i refuse to replace it with anything else until the next day  she is pretty fussy  i had really hoped she would like this  oh well  not chewy s fault  p s  i ordered two  the salmon   turkey  the turkey was a total fail  salmon a little better 
quality	i tried this as part of the bogo and my cats will not touch it  i tried for several days with no success 
product	we have 4 cats and we bought this food because of the buy 1 get 1 free deal it sounded like a good deal  the good news is our oldest cat likes it   he actually stopped scratching as this was a constant issue with him  the bad news is only 2 of our 4 cats will eat it  we do not want to buy multiple different types of food that would be expensive we will not buy this food again  we will try to find another brand that all 4 cats will eat  and also keeps the older cat from scratching 
health	i wanted to see if going back on grain free would help one of my kitties with allergies  this food does not smell good  my kitties do not seem to like it and it is in such small pieces it is easy to suck them down when they eat so fast  not sure i can recommend it  my cats are not picky eaters and they do not seem to care for it  
quality	i ordered this food due to the quality ingredients and that it was on special  i was previously feeding another cat food they liked very well but it has been discontinued so decided to try this  i have 12 cats and none of them like it  i put some out for the feral cats outside and the bowl has been full for 2 days  highly unusual    they are not eating it either  i had such high hopes for this food and am very disappointed that my cats do not like it  so i am still searching for a replacement for the discontinued cat food   sigh 
quality	i have 3 cats they were on hills science and royal canin they like new things so i bought them this brand because it was natural they hated it and it smells i have never had a cat food that smells so bad i had to throw it out good riddance
quality	i have three cats and they just did not care for it one just meowed till i gave him something else i will stick with natural balance i donated the bag
product	bag is ripped open and cat food now fills the box  guess i am getting some zip lock bags  really need to work on packaging 
quality	my cats will not eat this food  i will donate it to our local animal shelter  maybe they will eat it 
health	poor quality food  my cats got sick from it  can’t keep it down 
quality	unfortunately my cat would not eat the dry friskies that i bought  it was a 20lb bag and i had to give it away  he is also not eating friskies canned food all the time  so i switched to fancy feast  i wonder if i could get a different dried cat food 
quality	i will not be reordering this dry food  the feral cats  which have been spayed and neutered  that live in my area are watched over by a few neighbors  they will not eat this food  the come  they sniff it and walk away 
quality	the cats do like the food i do not like the way the fur feels now not soft and fluffy  so going back previous food which i can purchase locally  thank u
quality	unfortunatelt my cat refused to eat this cat food  i giftedit to some body else 
quality	as usual the cat that needs this food does not like it  he prefers food with lots of gravy and smaller chunks of the actual food 
quality	my cat loves the  pate  but would not eat this combo of morsels   gravy  not even mixed with the pate or dry food  he is a very picky eater 
health	my furry baby had 3 urinary tract obstruction  spent 5 days in er as i wept because of his demise  the vet recommended this for a sustained period of time  amidst the glowing reviews  i thought there is no way i can go wrong with this  but furry baby thought otherwise  he refuses to eat it  i made tuna water and mixed into it and that did not work  dab of salmon oil never worked  mixed with a little of the purina ut food and that hardly work but its the only way i get him to  at least  eat some of it  because of his finicky ways  i have to literally stay by his side throughout each meal to keep pushing food to form a mound as that is the only way i get him to eat some of it  plus he never eat
health	my cat needs prescription food  and normally she eats the royal canin urinary so hard food  i thought she would love this  but she hates it    she tried eating a little bit out of desperation when i mixed it in with her hard food one day  and she threw up everywhere  i spent so much money and now i cannot use it   
quality	my male cat recently developed bladder stones and underwent surgery  the vet instructed that he follow a urinary diet so i ordered this canned food as he is a gravy lover  unfortunately  he is very  very finicky eater  i had difficulty finding something he would like before this occurred   and he does not care for these morsels  wish i could have somehow gotten just a few cans to try before purchasing  the product looks good  but he just will not eat it 
quality	i am sure this is a good product but my tiga could not eat it  it upset her stomach 
health	chewy com is great  fast shipping  decent prices and loads of help if you need it  my problem was with my picky little girl cat  she does not understand why she has to eat this stuff  the few times i actually got some in her she promptly threw it all back up  she was prescribed this food from our vet because of urinary tract crystals  we have had better luck with the dry form of this food  at least she will eat it  i know they wanted her to have as much fluids as possible  so i provide water in as many ways as i can around the house  she is doing much better now 
quality	this food made our cat puke  he cannot eat it  which is unfortunate because the food is expensive  i am sure it is a quality cat food but this one is not for is  
quality	i purchased this at the recommendation of my vet  but i have to admit the ingredients are terrible  by products  i typically would never feed my pets anything with such low quality ingredients  but i am doing so as a means to reduce my cats urinary crystals  so i gave this two stars if it is able to alleviate any pain or discomfort 
quality	this cat food may be good for the health of your cat but my cats do not like the taste  when i went ahead and mixed it with other cat food that they liked then they ate it  i would recommenc it on the taste but food health reasons i might
quality	the only part my cat will try to eat is the white meat chicken with greens  the other on this split shipment  he will not touch  i will only purchase the shipment again if the whole box contains the one he will eat 
product	i had ordered several of the 12 can cartons of fancy feast medleys  both chicken and tuna  at a good price  i ordered them to have on hand over the winter and stored them without opening the cartons   as i have opened each carton over the last few months  have found many cans dented  several severely dented  this is not chewy s fault  as fancy feast pulled the wool over chewy s eyes 
quality	this brand is probably good  but the cat will not eat this brand as well  maybe the sauces or herbs  she will not eat it  will not buy the medley again 
product	i was trying something new and as usual my 4 feline companions did not appreciate my choice  luckily i have a friend w  a family member who is a cat person so i will have to give it to her  ps  their rarely seems to be any sales low prices on the particular items i purchase  and with 4 cats things can get rather expensive  hopefully with my next purchase i will see a change 
quality	they do not like all of these varieties  not sure why  i ended up giving most of the food to a raccoon 
quality	i bought this item a few years ago and discovered how much my cats hate chicken pate that is extremely  fragrant  and reeks of fish  my cats will not eat it at all after the first few bites  i am sure there are some out there that will love it but my three cats are not in the category  hopefully  i will not forget that chicken feast from fancy feast means fish 
quality	hello  i ordered 2 cases of this chicken feast classic  the first one was ok  the second case is bad  i’ve opened several cans  smells bad  and cat won’t touch it  i went to market and bought the same thing to hold me over and my cat is eating the market purchased classic chicken fancy feast just fine 
quality	ff classic chicken feast had been my cat s favorite ff wet food for a couple of years  she would happily eat 1 can daily  but over the last year and half  she gradually began eating less and less  now she refuses to eat more a bite or two  even when i mix it with another mild chicken formula  sheba   like another reviewer  i noticed the product is denser and a much darker color  and i assume ff made a significant change to the formula  did they increase the amount of chicken by products  like liver  which my cat hates  badly done  fancy feast 
product	i ordered two cases of the classic chicken feast and neither of my two cats like it  in fact  it sits until i throw it away and replace with something else  it is dark in color  does not have the scent or appearance of chicken  same with ff classic salmon  also disappointing  only ff i currently approve of are the the assortment of mixed medleys  i primarily feed with merrick and other more nutritious brands that are more wholesome  grain free  w no by products  infinitely more expensive  but well worth it when one considers the overall health benefits  plus less food waste  in general  insofar as pet foods  one gets the dollar benefits in the better health of cats and dogs  no doubt about
quality	my cats love chicken  yet do not care for this particular one  they just will not eat it   cannot understand why  
quality	i would not normally recommend this food only becuz there are higher quality wet foods like wellness but my cat does not care for high end  but    any wet food is better than hard kibble so she gets this cuz she likes the flavor  thanks 
quality	neither one of my cats will touch this food  my vet prescribed it  i bought a whole case and only one can has been opened  they will not go near it 
product	my sweet boy had had two blockage very difficult and extremely expensive but it’s imperative he on px food but will only eat a little big can goes to waste need this one pate in small can too need it to taste better too i have to add olive oil lite so he wil eat lol
quality	i had to purchase this food because my cat has a kidney disorder  she does not like it  i have to mix a bit of her favorite food with this in order for her to eat it  so disappointed 
health	after an emergency visit and a 3 day stay at the hospital  my male cat who had a total urethra blockage was sent home with a prescription for this food and a few others to help eliminate the crystals he is making  i am still not sure if he likes it  cats can be finicky  i may have to try a different flavor or brand  chewy was super easy to work with to get this prescription filled 
quality	all three of my cats hated this  my big boy  who eats anything  cannot even stand the smell  the smell    it stinks up the entire house  how do i get a refund  this is expensive 
product	none of my 3 cats will eat this  will be donating 22 cans to the animal shelter  will not buy anymore online unless they have eaten it before  if i could get a few cans of different types  flavors instead of purchasing a case  wasted 50 bucks
quality	my cat is not a fan of this food  however he cannot eat anything else due to his urinary problems  he will eat just a little then goes more for the dry urinary care that i also feed him  even though he has had the surgery that made him a her  he still forms crystals on regular food and tends to have difficulty urinating  so basically i have no other options  i have tried the other flavor fish   and he likes that even less 
quality	my cat charlie  who eats everything  turned away from this and will not touch it     so i am stuck with expensive food that no one will eat 
quality	i am sorry  i should have never purchased this item  momma kitty will eat it on occasion  but peanut will not go near it  from all the rave reviews i read  everyone mixes the two but my cats still do not care for it  maybe others would like this for a steady diet  but my cats would not touch it with a ten foot pole 
quality	this is not the same food you get from the vet  our cats loved the vet product  but would not touch the product that was delivered 
health	we are of course feeding this product based on a veterinarian s prescription  fortunately  the cat who it was prescribed for has not had a recurrence of urinary tract problems  but  while one would expect that a prescription product would be very consistent from batch to batch  the texture of this food is highly variable  we sometimes get an entire case that all four of our cats will refuse to eat   even one who was not prescribed the product but will usually gobble up  anything    this is a problem we have also had occasionally with hill s non prescription science diet canned foods  it is not just one finicky eater  all four cats just shun the product when we start a new case 
health	this was prescribed by my cat s veterinarian  the day he came home from having his bladder flushed because he had crystals he gobbled it down  that was probably only because he had not eaten for two days at the vet  since then he will not touch it  i have three other cats the turn their nose up at it too  i am donating rest of the case that i purchased back to my emergency vet so when they release other cats that have something to eat without going and buying it 
health	our cat has issues with crystallizations forming in his kidneys which prevents him from passing urine  after an emergency vet visit  the vet put him on this food  we fed our cat this food exclusively for awhile but were not comfortable with our cat only eating a food with pork by product as the first ingredient  after a year of exclusively eating this food  we switched up his feedings to only have a half can of this and a whole can of wellness  i wish they made a urinary care food with better ingredients but i cannot complain about this food as our cat has not had any further kidney urine issues since going on this food 
quality	after the first few days 3 out of 5 cats would not eat it  just sniff and walk away 
quality	i cannot really give a bad review but my cat with the bladder problem would not eat this  fortunaely i have another cat that does eat it and the vet said it wont hurt her  my cat will eat the dry c d food
quality	well i got to say i only buy this food because it is been now that 2 of my male cats have had crystals in their urine which caused me to take them to the vet and the vet prescribed the food  i prefer to give them the wet kind instead of the kibble since i have read that the soft food is better for their teeth  the reason i am giving 3 stars is because it is not organic foods in it and they only have the meatloaf chicken and the meatloaf fish on the 5 5 size can  wish they would have more flavors since my cats get bored with the chicken and will not touch the fish  i guess when it comes to peace of mind i rather not loose my cats at a young age and give them this food  it is much cheaper to buy it
health	i am feeding this science diet product to my cat because he developed kidney issues whereby he makes crystals in his urine that cut him while they pass through his system  he was a pretty sick kitty until we got this under control  that being said  i do not like a lot of the ingredients in science diet products and would much rather feed him a food made with carefully sourced ingredients that are organically grown and with no chemicals  fillers  and or byproducts included but i have no choice  i cannot in good conscience recommend this or any other science diet product to anyone unless you also have no other choices 
quality	6 kittens not eating as yet  so i hope they like when old enough 
health	i feed it to my cat who is just over 1 year  because she needs small kibbles to keep from choking or hacking  it is working for her and easy on my wallet  my mom s cat he is 6 years and likes the kibbles too 
product	while there are definitely kitten foods with better ingredients the prices are just too high for people on a fixed  disability  budget  the kitten loves this stuff and thrives on it  shiny silky coat  bright eyes  and full of energy and play  i bought it to see if it would be acceptable  half expecting to have to switch to a more expensive product but it is great 
product	the cats are loving their new food  the bag came torn and it seemed to be okay  was not due to shipping so that is a bit disappointing 
quality	after feeding my cats for 3 days on this dry food they developed very soft runny stools  must use in moderation and not as only dry food 
quality	i bought this food to help my cat lose weight  so far  she is just not eating it  i do not want her to lose weight by starvation  i will give it another week or so and then change breaks if she still does not take to it 
health	i have tried weight control in the past  my cat will not eat it  this time i added some of his leftover mature cat hairball control    and he ate it  but i am running very low on hairball control for mature cats  and do not find it on your website 
product	tried this particular blend for the first time  one cat loved it  the other wouldn’t have anything to do with it  will try another flavor in this package tonight to see if we can find a favorite for both  the quality ingredients of the food looks to be great  just not for one of the girls 
quality	my cats smell primavera and walked away  i thought i ordered florentine collection they loved  unfortunately ordered 2 cases  i opened both  can i return the single cans  have 23 left 
product	my cat did not like it  very disappointed especially the price of it i would have been better off going to local grocery store  pet smart or walmart michelle
quality	i ordered the sheba cuts for a change because my cats love sheba pate  but  they do not like the cuts and will not eat it 
quality	cats smelled this and all of them walked away from all flavors
quality	my cats like sheba but it is too hard to open so i’m changing to something in a can so i can open the can with a can opener
product	i just opened my 2nd box of 48 servings of sheba for my guys and the product is damaged  the box is fine so had no idea of internal damage  never had an issue like this  does this get replaced  
product	my indoor cat loves them  she has hyperthyroidism  is underweight  and i read that any wet food is better for cats with her condition  however  i am a stroke victim  and my hands do not work like they use to  the packages are hard for me to open  there is also always some gravy left in the container and the package is an odd shape  so it is wasted  she cannot get her head in there  i always get some on my hands which is unpleasant to me  i do not want to switch her to the meow mix  because it is too much for her at one time  she gets 3 of these a day 
product	overall quality of food is good and my cat enjoys it  but i just hate the packaging  1st it is way over packaged with thick box and additional plastic separators inside   no good for planet  the foil cover of each can is hard to pull off so i end up with mess all over my hands while trying to open it  portion is so small for a grown up cat  i end up giving both halves of the can to my cat anyway  so all and all good idea on the paper but poor execution on packaging 
product	i am not sure that this food is grain free  it does not say it on the package  yet it was advertised as being grain free on chewy  i am confused and concerned  as my cats are supposed to be on a grain free diet 
quality	he will not eat it  i think it is the texture it is really full of air  he likes the other sheba foods but hates the pate  but will eat 9 lives pate 
quality	i have 2 cats and neither one of them liked the chicken or turkey  they do love other sheba perfect portions meals however  must be something about the turkey and chicken that they do not like  chewy however is a great company to do business with 
quality	needs to have more gravy and much smaller chunks  i do not like throwing away the big chunks  wasteful 
product	i originally thought this was a great idea  just pull off the top and give it to the cats  no dish to mess with  my cats end up just chasing the dish around and not being able to get the food out of the dish  the dish is just to small  once i scoop the food out and put it in a dish they will eat it but until i do that they only chase the dish around  i would not buy this again 
product	i do not use this as a regular meal for my cats  it is more like a little snack when they are not full or are begging for more food  the portions are quite small  one thing that is super annoying is every single time i open the package it splashes gravy  a bit gross 
quality	the packaging is extremely difficult to open  every time i went to open a new tray the air inside would cause the tin lid to  pop  open spilling out cat food on my hands and counter  every single pouch had this issue  i also do not like that they went from making 3oz cans which are easy to recycle to this plastic stuff with tin foil lids that is only 2 6 oz  but as for the quality of ingredients and palatability  its very good  my kitten loved every flavor  and i felt that it was a great quality food for an excellent price 
quality	jonny loves the sheba treats so i bought these  had to throw out some because it looked like brown stuff smeared over the bottoms of the cups  he will not eat the others 
quality	cats will not eat  nothing good in these  they would rather starve than eat this  complete waste of money  i should of known better  quality versus quantity  never again will i purchase or recommend to anyone 
product	packaging is convenient but the pull tab tends to be very difficult  my kittens prefer the pate  which is simply a matter of their personal preference  the small cans with the pull tab and pate meal is preferred by them and i 
quality	my cat hated it  he would not eat it at all  i tried all three different flavors with him  he would not touch  the portions are to small for adult cats 
product	it seems like when sheba discontinued the cans of food in favor of these perfect portions  they changed the formula because while my cats will eat it  they do not gobble it down the way they used to with the cans  also  the price is the same or higher for less food  i am also not a fan of excessive packaging in the form of plastic and the foil tops spit out cat food juice every time i tried to open it  i will not be buying this anymore  i wish they would bring back the cans with the old formula 
product	i wish sheba would go back to the cans  these packets are a pain to open and i always get  juice  on the counter and my hands  plus  the plastic is so light that my kitties push it all over so i have to scoop it out into a dish before putting it out  overall  these are messy and i probably will not buy them again  the only reason they got two stars instead of one is because my kitties like the food 
health	i bought this indoor cat food only because the kind i always buy was out of stock for for the last couple of months  my one cat wouldn’t touch it and my other cat seems to be vomiting a lot  so i don’t know if it’s because of his food  i just stopped giving it to him  cats are carnivores and i believe the food companies should stay away from the rice and veggies in the food 
product	all of the cans in this container were dented  the dog food i ordered was fine  but if this is how the canned cat food will come i will not order from you 
product	almost the whole case of canned food was damaged  at first i thought it was just a few cans  but ended up being more just a few  the product itself is great  my cats love it 
quality	i have two indoor cats that will not eat this  i also have 14 stray cats that also declined to eat it  make your own judgment on this product  wait       maybe it is because they have been eating the fancy feast seafood grill for 2 8 years and prefer not to change           
product	box was not crushed but there were four cans that were crushed and open in carton
quality	my girls would not eat  i think they did not like the texture they only like pate pate brands 
product	the food is okay  my cat likes some flavors and not others  that said  i have bought more expensive foods for him  and the outcome is the same  he likes some  others not so much 
quality	not sure why but my indoor cat that will eat anything  including the dog food  does not like this canned variety 
quality	my cats are finicky and for whatever reason are not happy with their food of late  not sure why  they do like the indoor food with the greens in them better than the regular food  but will not eat it every day even though different flavors 
quality	my inside cats would lick it and then walk away i thought maybe because they were used to pate that it would take some time i finally gave up and tried to use it to feed my feral neighborhood cats   even they left it almost untouched i ve never experienced this before  maybe a bad batch what s even odder is my dog who has no problems eating cat food whenever she gets a chance would not touch this 
health	i had found bugs in the cat food that i did not notice at first then my cat was getting sick and one day i went to give hi his food and noticed the bugs   i contact smuckers  rachael ray food distributor they said their was nothing they could do but give me a coupon for more of the same food    not   will not purchase again
quality	my cat refuses to eat this food    so i will not be buying again
quality	my cats are not fans of this  i had been feeding american journey for quite a while  but they lost interest  i decided to try nutrish  since it had good ingredients  but the cats just will not eat it  it does have a really small kibble though  which mine tend to prefer 
quality	cats will not eat it  it is left in their bowls to throw away  will not buy again 
quality	none of my cats would even try to eat this  it was as if there is a smell or look about the product that they just do not like  craziest thing i have ever seen  would not even eat other foods mixed with it  glad i purchased a small bag to try  because it is a loss 
quality	my two big toms are not picky but they will not touch rachel ray catfood  last time i tried feeding them  nutrish  i got a look like  are you kidding  rachel ray  no way   then i tried mixing it with friskies and the big one tried to bite me 
product	my cat loves this food but i was sadly disappointed with the function or should i say malfunction of the bag  after opening bag by pulling string and op ning a corner of bag i lift bag and 12 lbs of cat food spills onto floor as the bottom of the bag has unglued  what should have been a five minute transfer of food into cat bowl into a 20 minute clean up rachel glue is good
quality	since its natural i thought my guys would like it  the size of the kibble is small which is perfect for them  unfortunately  they do not like the taste  i had to go back to royal canin and fromm
product	it says plainly on the front of the packaging   no ground corn  yet the third ingredient listed is corn gluten meal  there is no such thing as corn gluten  it is just corn meal 
health	as another reviewer stated  there is corn gluten in this cat food  i do not think that rachael ray should advertise this as a  no corn  food  i bought this food for my 3 cats who is ages range between 4 and 12  the eldest  my maine coon and my  normally will eat anything  cat  would not even sniff it  my middle aged cat ruby smelled it and walked away  my youngest ate a few bites and never went back  all 3 have very sensitive stomachs and i wonder if they knew the corn gluten would upset their bellies  i normally feed nutrisource grain free  but it is getting soo expensive  and this was supposed to be a good food  not as healthy as implied though  try a small bag first and go from there  but i cannot
quality	my cat would not eat it so i donated it to my local cat shelter 
quality	did not like this food krishna never ate the food  smelled it and walked away 
quality	would not eat it at all came back 30 minutes later smell it did not eat it  i do not know y my cat would not eat it i am sorry about it i thought this would be a better choice for them but i guess not
quality	my cat does not like pate  so i am trying different type of food she is not crazy for this brand
product	i would not buy this again  then again mr  boo is picky  he would not take one bite and had to toss the meat  not your fault 
quality	my older cat really likes this food but the other one will not eat it at all  i believe it is because it is fish and my cats do not like fish of any kind  i am not sure why all cat food manufacturers think cats like fish 
quality	my cats did not eat this food enthusiastically  there were frequently leftovers in the bowls when i fed the blue buffalo  they did not like blue wilderness treats either  maybe my cats are not gourmands 
quality	it might be a very good product but my cat did not like it and will not eat it 
quality	i’ve never had my cat refuse to eat wet food    until i put this in front of him  i tried every flavor    nope  perhaps we got a bad batch  i’m not sure  but this is going to the donation bin 
quality	i purchased this variety pack of blue buffalo food for my two cats thinking that it is a premium line  however  both of my cats have turned up their noses and refused to eat any of the flavors included in the box  so its back to royal canin for us 
quality	my inside kitty s would not eat this after the first can
quality	the food in the cans smelled bad   like they were old and expired shortly after opening
health	haven’t been able to get my cat to eat this yet  my cat is injured and now has kidney disease  good food is important 
quality	i have a picky old lady who i have to switch food often  she is picky in her old age of 13  i do not recommend this brand in general but its our go to when she refuses to eat  it is her junk food 
quality	i started feeding my girls nutrish which they loved but the packages are small so i tried this  i have 3 dogs and 2 out of the three do not like this   one of them just will not eat it  i am going back to nutrish     will just have to buy more which is going to be expensive 
quality	my picky cats looked at it and walked away  i do not know why they are so finicky 
quality	good product but i have 3 cats and 2 of them did not eat it so not a good buy for me
quality	but my cats were not interested    i hate throwing food away  oh well 
quality	it may very well be good food  but my cat would not eat it 
product	i purchased this because it was advertised to be so great  not  i have 6 cats and they would hardly eat it and most of the time not  had the same problem with the dry food they make  the consistency was terrible  some cans chunky some cans smooth like pate  no quality control at all  it is way too pricey to feed several cats but i thought i would try it
quality	i am sure this is a good food for cats  but my guy would not eat it 
quality	i would recommend this box  however my cat does not like chicken very much  the fish and shrimp and flaked tuna are a hit 
quality	they will not eat the chicken at all  and eat little of the others 
quality	i do not know why  but our cats would not touch this food  can after can went to the trash  i finally gave the remaining cans to the shelter 
quality	this might be healthy but my cats would not eat it  they would rather go hungry 
quality	despite the photos and the description  this food is not flakey  it most definitely is more pâté  my finicky boy who will not touch pâté would not eat this 
quality	well  i was hoping that variety was the spice of life for my two cats  it seems that they are very particular in their choices  so i better stick to the kind they like  i thought that this cat food was on the dry side  since they are gravy suckers  they put their noses up and refused to eat it 
quality	thought i would order something new for my cats for the new year  but they both will not eat it  so i guess i will donate to a feral group
quality	this food had the consistency of soft kibbles in gravy  my cats refuse to eat this kind of food unfortunately 
quality	some of these they eat  others they turn their noses up at
product	the package indicates that the food has gravy  but it really doesn t  it is moist but no gravy and my cats do not want anything that does not have gravy  the stray cat wins again 
product	my cat loves the gravy part of this  she licks it all right away  however  she leaves almost all the meat chunks  so i will not be purchasing this again  i do give this to her for a  treat  since the water in the liquid is good for her  chewy is the best  their delivery is amazingly fast   
quality	we have been with another purina product fancy feast for a while and our 3 cats really have enjoyed it  esp the one with a touch of cream  but it is always the gravy that they like the most and thought this would be worth a try  there is a lot of gravy and of course they love that  but then they get filled up on it and do not eat the actual food pieces  as long as they are happy  then so am i  but i also hate wasting anything  throwing away the actual food food that is in it stinks  it is not bad though so i have been alternating this in the am and fancy feast in the pm  i take whatever is left over from this in the am and mix it into the pm feeding  and that works great 
product	i got my order today    not happy  there were 3 cans of the beef flavored that were crushed and one was crushed so badly it was all over the rest of the cans  this was not completely the fault of chewy though as i think it came that way from the packing plant  as the box they were in was not damaged that much  although i think someone would have noticed something at the plant or at chewy before it was sent to me 
product	my cat loves the food  but the packaging and or handling needs improving  two cans were split open which meant gravy spilled over every other can    making a royal mess  plus i lost the two cans  not knowing how long they had been opened  cans are thin aluminum  so need better protection 
quality	sorry  friskies  cat refuses to eat any of these chunky extra gravy varieties   we leave it as his only food and he just starves himself rather than eat more than a taste  then he is drinking lots of water like he needs to get taste out  odd since he licks the gravy off all other varieties  i think they are too chunky hard to chew and may have spices in them that are unappealing  gravy seems quite watery  guess i will be donating these 
product	i love all of the products you sell  the only problem i have is the cases of wet cat food  it seems with every order the case gets mashed and i have 4 to 5 cans that are damaged  i have 17 cats in my household so i need every can  this last order five of these cans were damaged 
quality	this can does have lots of gravy but his cats would not eat them and that it does not have much meat in the cans  i rather use pate and add gravy into the cans 
quality	our kittens do not like the food  they stuck tgere noses up at it so we donated it
product	bought this because my cats like food with gravy  this food has plenty of extra gravy but my cats are not at all thrilled with it  i was disappointed 
product	some cans were damaged  did not have time to request replacement
quality	my cats absolutely hated all of these flavors  only licked the gravy out of one flavor but did not touch and other flavors or gravy and i ended up just giving the rest to the animal shelter 
product	product was not delivered as promised   extra gravy chunky variety pack canned cat food 6 cans of each pictured on the box  there were 14 cans of chunky beef extra gravy  6 cans chunky of turkey 3 cans with salmon and 1 chunky chicken in extra gravy  i was very disappointed with the 24 can variety pack  called complained  order was replaced waiting its arrival  thank you for the replacement  i would recommend only if the variety pack contained the 6 can each flavor that friskies promised  was in the box 
quality	put my cat vinni on the c d diet because it was recommended by my vet  vinni cannot get used the new food and always has a liquid stool after food  i switched the new food slowly as recommended but after about a month of use  still the stool is runny like water
health	my cat vomited after eating c d even though i mixed it with her other dry food  vomiting occurred three times after eating  when i discontinued c d vomiting stopped  i cannot blame the food  most cats do have certain food intolerances 
quality	my cat ate it for 2 days  but then stopped  will not eat it at all  i hate to see her so hungry
health	mimi likes the one with cheese the best  she also loves the gravy  i like the variety  she only likes poultry but i do not want to just give her the same thing every day  she will get tired of it  i used to feed her another brand but she only ate one flavor  got sick of it and refused canned food 
quality	i clicked on several  friskies  pate w poultry  what it gave me were pate s with seafood in it  which my cats will not eat  finally i found one that said  poultry  cans  what it did not advertise  unless you click on the individual can s pictured  is that this food is not pate  as i always request  please be advised that this product is not  poulty pate 
health	i have fed this to my cats before but this time they will hardly eat it and my cat have gotten really sick
product	about half the cans were dented not leaking but certainly deeply dented 
quality	my cats do not care for this type  they prefer the pate  they lick the graveyard off and much later might eat the remaining portion
product	many of the cans were dented when they arrived  some seals were broken including a can that could not be opened with the flip top
quality	i have a pretty diverse group of felines in my house from the complex stray who eats anything  the greedy 17 lb  fat guy  the 10 month old rambunctious kitten and the fickle silver tabby  to have all 4 of these guys  including a starving stray  walk away from all of these varities and eat slices of cheese instead      i had to give this variety a poor rating especially since its sooo many cats to have them turn their noses up to 
quality	most of the cans of food are fine but the shreds are so disgusting that even the starving feral outdoor cats walk away from it  that stuff does not even look like food to me  plan on switching to a case that does not include shreds 
quality	our kitty loves the other flavors  especially salmon but did not eat a single bit of the chicken  no reflection on chewy  great service 
product	shipped quick  decent price and pack was sealed and in good shape  no dented cans etc  the item was advertised as 40 cans  4 flavors  10 each  received 3 flavors  20 mariner  10 salmon  10 ocean   no chicken and tuna 
quality	my babies do not care for this brand or flavor  they usually devour their canned treats  but not this one  good buy for the money  but my cats like quality rather than quantity 
quality	fiber response dry food looks  smells and seems good to me but is not working out for my kino kitty  he refused to eat it and then when i mixed a little with his regular prescribed dry food he ate a little and then threw the whole thing up 
product	chewy s prices are best around but even then  it helps to be a  royal  when it comes to paying for it  the makers of this product must be lighting their cigars with big bills on their yachts in monaco after learning pricing from the medical field  slap  prescription only  on the label and gouge the buyer  check the ingredients  beet pulp must be very expensive 
health	i ordered this chewy product  because it was prescribed by my cat s veterinarian  my cat had diarrhea and he said this should help bulk firm up his stools  that has not happened  my cat s stool is as loose as it was before  but now there is more of it  the vet is looking into alternate treatments  i am considering requesting a refund 
quality	my cats love gravy so i thought they would enjoy this but they will not touch it 
product	cat not enjoying my choice for him seems to be too finicky
quality	my 15 yr old cat has early kidney issues and other health challenges and the vet recommended this as an alternative to kidney diets which the cat will not touch  it would not appear on any top rated or high quality foods for cats  but it is the only canned food our cat will eat  though he leaves the chunks of food and just slurps up the gravy  something is better than nothing at this point 
quality	food was awful  food was crumbling  entire bag  not just at the bottom form settlement   i have purchased meow mix in the past  and never experienced such low quality 
quality	this seems to work for other cats according to other reviews  but none of my 4 cats will touch the stuff  even some of the strays will not eat it 
quality	so  one of our cats has had to have struvite crystals surgically removed twice in her life  once when owned by previous owner  once with us   so i was told to switch her to urinary care foods  this cat is fussy  she despises pate and wants it to rot  that eliminates half the market  there are two urinary care products left  you are in for a very boring life  anya   this is one of them  i got a 24 pack of it as she devoured the sample from the vet  the big problem i have with this is the smell  cap it immediately  and wash up the dishes the moment the cat s tongue leaves the dish because holy cow  this one stinks my house up like no other cat food i have ever encountered  i have an air purifier
quality	my cat prefers to eat the hill s urinary care c d tuna vegetable stew over the chicken flavored  she does not eat all of her food she leaves most of this chicken flavored wet food in her bowl even when i add delectables fish flavored gravy treat to it 
quality	my cat does not like this at all  he does like the other item i ordered
quality	but the kitties are not happy with it  they will lick the juice but will not eat the meat 
quality	my cat loves this food  and he is a very picky eater  i buy the 24 quantity case  however  every once in a while  the food will turn out dry and lumpy from a new can  which the cat will not eat  even though the  sell by date  is still good  the food looks old and dried out  in the past two orders  i would say i have encountered this problem 4 or 5 times  do not know if it is a quality control issue or a packaging issue 
quality	my cats do not eat this  they just pick off the gravy 
quality	unfortunately neither one of my cats will eat this  they both turn their nose up and will not eat this  so it looks like i am stuck with a case of food    ugh
quality	vet insisted on this and i find it too expensive  my cat does not like it at all 
quality	i ordered this because i noticed it was a new  flavor  of the c d urinary care prescription food my cats have to be on to keep them healthy  i have been feeding them the basic chicken flavor but over time they have become less interested in it so when i saw this i thought i would try it to see if they liked it better  well they didn t  they ate it for a few days and then after that stopped eating it entirely  also  i did not realize when i bought it that these cans are much smaller than the larger cans the other c d wet food comes in  so i have to feed them twice as many cans in a day  they eat 2x day  around 2 5 3oz each   with the other cans  which are 5 5oz  i just split a can and throw a little
quality	after an overnight vet trip for a urinary blockage  my cat was prescribed this food for the next six months  he will not touch it  and this is not your typical finicky cat either  hank has never turned his nose up to any food in his three years  something about this food he just really does not like  he flips his bowl over so i have to throw it out  so unfortunately we are stuck with a case of it 
health	my cat and two dogs have been on blue buffalo for awhile now and lately they haven’t been liking the food as much  not sure if it’s because i switched the type of blue buffalo or not but what i have noticed with the cat foods by blue is they have a really gross smell to them  i figured it was just the hairball control so i decided to try this one grain free chicken and it also has a nasty smell to it  when we walk by the bowl it’s just a disturbing funk smell  so i purchased a different brand of food and we will see how that goes    
health	i purchased this to try it on my cat because she has a sensitive stomach and throws up often  i have been desperately trying to find a food that would work  unfortunately  i got the same results 
health	i am sure it is perfectly fine but my cat will not touch it  i had hoped it would help her constipation as it was mentioned in an article 
product	cats did not like flavor  bowl after bowl was just left  for me big waste of money for a product that does not appeal to the cats 
health	although my cat had less vomiting issues  she would not eat this 
health	i have three cats  2 out of 3 cats ate the food and seemed to have no problems but one of my cats kept throwing it up  she has seemed to have a sensitive stomach  and is a picky eater  since we got her over a year ago 
quality	i purchased this thinking it was a great buy because of all the commercials i watch about blue buffalo  i have two very un finicky cats  neither one likes the food  they eat it only if they are very hungry  eg  i have been at work for 10 hours  it also has a strong odor that i am not fond of  the ingredients are great  but to no avail if they will not eat it 
quality	i decided to give this a try  i kept a bowl of this for 10 days and my cat would not eat it 
quality	i am not sure what happened here  but my indoor outdoor kitty was not a fan of this food  he is not a picky eater at all  but will not go near this food  i think it may be the ball shaped kibble bits that throws him off  maybe he is just gotten used to a certain size and shape of kibble  seems like it is a great cat food and all based on ingredients and i wish i could give it a better review  but unfortunately i can t 
quality	i was surprised that my cats would not eat this  they eat other flavors from fancy feast but the beef is not a winner in our house  it has the same consistency as there other pate flavors 
product	yes  because it is one of the only canned cat foods that my 2 seniors will eat  no  because it is not what i want them eating  i would much rather they ate a good quality food  which this really isn t  if i could find a quality   meat and supplements  premium food that my cats would eat  i would never buy another can of fancy feast 
quality	my cats informed me when i fed this to them that they just really do not like beef flavored cat foods and this was no exception 
quality	this is a fine product  i am sure  but my cat will not eat it  so i bought the friskies shreds and she is fine with that one  chewy com is the only way to go  fast service and great prices 
quality	not all the cats in the shelter can have seafood  i bought this because friskies changed the formula on their tasty treasures chix and turkey which none of the cats will eat anymore even the cats who will eat anything   threw away 2 cases 
quality	o my    do not know what they did to this food   my cats have been eating this brand but the extra grave must taste horrible   the gravy looks more like water and they will not touch it   i have wasted about 5 cans and wasted the price i paid    good luck to who every buys   hope your cats aren’t as picky  or are they      
quality	i bought this 24 pack of cat food because i thought that my cat s might like extra gravy  they do not and will not eat it 
product	few cans were badly damaged bared able to open them because of the damage to the top
quality	i do not suggest buying this  it is mushy and has completely different coloring than the regular pate  cats would not touch any of the flavors
quality	this product would have gotten 5 stars  however  my finicky 18 year old would not eat most of it 
quality	my cats usually do not care for pate but since it had extra gravy i gave it a try  it is not something i would order again  the gravy was pretty much contained in the food and they walked away from it  they like more liquid form  i tried adding water  broth but could not interest them in eating it unless i gave them nothing else all day 
product	i ordered this since my cats seem to like the gravy foods  picky as they can be   this food is just a lot of juicy not the gravy food i was expecting at all  have opened 3 cans so far and all five turned up nose at it and frankly i am very disappointed it is not like the actual gravy food i picked up in the store for them to try before ever purchasing 
quality	great price but my cats prefer the regular pate from friskies  i tried this just for variety but the cats weren’t into it  threw away more left overs than usual 
product	paté seems more firmly pressed together than regular paté so the extra “gravy”  juice  is needed just to make it more moist  cats like it  but not really any more than regular paté  i probably won’t buy this again  as it’s not really any different than just stirring up regular paté 
quality	my cats did not like this at all walked away and let it dry out 
product	the cans were dented in the box when delivered at least 6 cans so far  not happy with this 
product	was looking for a lot of extra gravy for my elderly cat  he did not like this  will not buy again 
quality	surprised by friskies  my four cats enjoy their pate  so extra gravy wow sounded like a great idea  however it is not gravy at all just some type of extra juice  what they did with the pate i do not know  my cats would not eat any of the flavors even an outdoor cat i feed wanted no parts of it  i do not know what friskies did with this food but it sure was not a good thing 
quality	extra gravy is good idea  now they need to make the pate out of something the cats will eat   they just lick all the gravy off and leave whatever the pate is made of  i throw away more than they eat   they do not like anything chunky either  shredded or bites  we have been licking half a can for going on 20 years and throwing the rest away after it sits there and dries out 
quality	my kitties have absolutely no interest in this food  that being said i’ve noticed the last few months the texture of almost all friskies pate purchased is a much firmer loaf than normal  almost like its overcooked  our kitties just won’t eat it anymore  i’ve tried several times to email friskies concerning this issue but apparently emails won’t go thru via their website  so for now i’ll purchase the pate flavors that still have the normal texture and if they change those as well will just change brands altogether
health	one of the bags that i ordered  i think was contaminated  it made my cat boots sick and i had to throw it out  it would be nice if i could receive a credit on this item  i am having to switch over to a different type of food to be safe 
health	so far so good  my cat as a lot of issues with cat foods and so far this one is a winner  she is not getting sick from it 
quality	hazel will not eat it  she is spoiled  but love purian vance feast with savory chicken and turkey
health	percy is 14 and sometimes has some digestive issues  vomiting etc  he recently decided he did not want his usual more expensive food  so i just ran to the store quickly and picked this up  he seems to be doing well  i did not give it a full rating because we are mixing it with cat chow complete  for the different flavors  i only wish this was available in a 1 pound box so we would not have too much food  percy is one cat and does not over eat so by the end of the mixture  4 5 pounds worth  we wind up having to throw it out because it is not fresh enough  we order monthly 
product	my cats love this stuff but the last package we got from chewy had maggots through the cans of sealed cat food  i may have to switch to another brand  and definately will not order this product from here again
quality	they did not like it  one cat threw it up all the time  the there would not touch it 
quality	i have a cat who will eat anything  but she will not eat this  i will be returning it  and never buying this brand again 
quality	i thought my cats would like it because it looks fancy  they walked away from it 5 out of 6 times
product	sheba food is good   gabby eats it without a fuss however the packaging is impossible to open    i am a senior lady with very little hand strength   arthritist in my wrists  i wont be purchasing sheba anymore because it is too painful to open 
quality	my two cats would not eat the seafood flavor and did not finish the salmon one  what a waste of money  i give them grain free food in pate  and had to buy another brand  because they are both senior cats  i have to be very careful of their diet and as all pet owners say  our fur babies deserve the best 
product	my two cats love this food  i love it because it is grain free  shame on sheba for making the portions so small  it becomes less attractive because now i have to triple the portions for the cats and it is now expensive  please sheba go back to the cans  no reflection on chewy  chewy comes through with the service 
quality	i learned again why   buying cheap    item was a deep discount  does not work with cats  all my taste testing felines turned their noses up  arguably they are never very hungry  but it still was rather dramatic 
quality	i always buy this same brand at store and she loves it  she will not eat any of these   every flavor i’ve tried giving her she smells and walks away  i’m thinking there is something wrong with them 
quality	tried to give my cat the chicken pate for supper and he smelled it and walked away  tried the supreme super and he ate that for his bedtime snack and asked for a little more   i gave him just a sample at first to see what he would do  scarfed it up  will try the tuna and chicken when the supreme supper is gone  could be that he just does not like the chicken  have not given up   if he continues to eat the supreme supper i will try some of the beef and fish flavors    i hope the 20  off offer will hold that long  only gave this particular package of food 3 stars because of the flavors in it not because of the food  was a great deal    just wish the fish and beef ones were the same price  but
quality	a good price  but not great food  it’s probably just the brand name  but it stinks pretty bad  more than any other cat food 
quality	no fault of chewy  but 9 lives mis labeled this product  while it says pate  favorites  50 percent were shreds instead  these cats cannot eat this so i have donated the product 
health	worst cat food ever  i feed my cat a diet of dry and wet food  we gave this one a try and she was vomiting for hours  it is cheap and not worth the risk  do not buy 
quality	i switched from a shredded canned cat food to this pate and my cats will not eat it 
quality	the cats are not eating this food i guess i will have to switch back to friskies
quality	usually my cats love this cat food they love the pate but they do not eat much of this 
quality	my 8 fur babies do not like it  it just sits in the bowl  i tried this because it comes as a 12 pk but it is back to friskies 
quality	my 20 year old started having issues eating dry food  her teeth are no longer healthy  we had been buying the same brand for years  we thought we would switch it up for her a bit  she won’t even lick the sauce  our other 2 cats also have no interest  not sure why these dislike it 
quality	you get what you pay for  food looks nasty  ingredients are nasty  two of my three will not eat it  disgusting 
product	1 of my 3 would try this  i think she ate it because she was hungry  will not buy it again 
quality	i was very disappointed to see artificial flavors when i read the ingredients  i will not eat foods that contain this and i do not want it in my cat s food either 
quality	my cat loves ff classic pate  liver and chicken in particular   and at first she seemed interested in this new item  but she only ate some of it once and then would not eat it again  it is extremely mushy  even after partial can was refrigerated   much more so than classic pate and she is not going for it 
product	ok so i know i’m really getting picky here but this food looks no where close to the picture  my cat eats with her eyes first  yes  i’m kidding  but honestly it is just a pate rebranded  in the can it was all mushed like all cat food  however i can say my cat loves it  i think i was just disappointed i didn’t get to put it on a plate and cut into it to have a gooey center run out  i did receive this product as a sample 
quality	my cat loves fancy feast grilled much better  he has been eating fancy feast for over 4 yrs  however  he did not like the new fancy feast savory centers  it looked good to me  but i do not eat it  as you know cats are every finicky about what they eat  we still love fancy feast 
product	after reading all the previous reviews  i thought my pride of cats would love it  not so much though  we have 5  one outside  one 4 month kitten and three ranging from 7 to 16  the kitten and outside cat ate all flavors  the others would eat some but not with enthusiasm  i was was surprised that of the 4 flavors  salmon was the most popular  and usually that is not a big seller in the food bowl  beef was the least favorite  i will not buy again 
health	the cats like these moderately well  but some of them throw up right after eating them  probably not worth the extra cost  the salmon and tuna were the preferred flavors  one concern  they all have this unappetizing reddish orange tint  so matter the flavor they all look the same 
health	our cats all loved  fancy feast savory centers   but they all got diarrhea from it  it is too rich by itself  mixing a little of it in with their regular food may help 
quality	we have eight cats and at first they gobbled it up but just the first day  after that they only stared at it  8 out of 8 cats do not like this food 
health	bought this because chewy had it at a good price  i am not really a fan of rachel ray s foods because i feel like they are sold as  premium foods  when with corn gluten meal as the third ingredient  it really is not  my cats liked it ok  however one of my cats who rarely throws up threw up twice one day   three times the next so i will probably not buy again  i will go back to purina one  which also is not premium  but seems to cause less digestive issues 
quality	very sorry  my cats do not like this  i will be removing it from my auto ship  i do not remember putting it there anyway 
product	i just got off chat line with chewy  they are refunding me for the rachel ray hard cat food  neither of my 2 cats will eat it  i always bought blue buffalo and just ordered another big bag  i must say i was shocked that neither of the 2 cats want anything to do with rachel 
quality	my cats would not eat this cat food and i ended up giving it away  i am very dissatisfied because of how much i paid for it 
product	this has nothing to do with the product itself  we have had multiple issues with our orders  our orders are constantly damaged  its not something that could during the shipment  bag are literally ripped open or split in half  not pelased
product	however they mostly loved shredding the bag   better packaging would be clutch
product	i do not think that my indoor cat and the two alley cats are not enjoying the combination of the ingredients in this dry cat food  all three cats eat very little of it  the next day there is always some dry food left in their bowls  i do not think i will be purchasing this dry food again for them 
quality	my cat turned her nose up when i first served it to her and she would not even touch it until i had not fed her anything else for two days and she was forced to eat it  your cat may feel differently about it but i was very disappointed that i had purchased an entire bag of something she did not like 
quality	first off i love chewy and spend a lot of money with them  we have 6 dogs and 6 cats  lol anyway    i am not saying rachel ray is not a good food  my cats did not like this food at all  i transitioned them over the course of 2 weeks and they look at me and meow like their starving because they will not eat it  poor babies   i bought a bag of their old food and all is well now  good luck and i hope y all have better luck 
quality	i had purchased another type of nutrish for my cats and they loved it  do not really know why they do not like this type  the kibble is very small and hard that may be one reason  just guessing  i could not keep the other in the bowl this one has their noses in the air walking away  very disappointing 
quality	my cats just will not eat this food i am not sure why i guess it does not taste good
quality	i purchased the indoor delights because of a recommendation since my cat does not go outside  he hates it  he refuses to eat even when mixed with his regular can food  i will not try this again  waste 
health	i believe all the five stars  just saying  that’s why i bought this flavor of special diet  expensive  food for my sick cat  but  am so disappointed to have an entire case of food that not even  my well cats  will eat  i noticed that compared to what i had ordered the month before  same brand  this canned food had really big chunks  it may just the different texture  it may be the taste  i don’t know  i’m bummed 
quality	have 2 cats they would not eat it  they like the dry food from hill but not wet 
quality	my cat will not eat it  i have to add a tiny bit of regular wet cat food of a similar flavor for him to eat a little bit  i will keep trying because he recently had surgery for urinary blockage and as to eat prescription food 
quality	my spoiled cat  and other house cats  would not eat this  not even for breakfast  when they all are anxious to eat  very picky eaters 
health	i got this product  along with several others  hoping it would encourage my cat  who has cancer  to eat  she laps at the liquid but my healthier cats  all seniors  seem to like it  it is not affordable for this multi cat household  but if you have only one or two cats  it is good for an occasional treat 
health	my cat seem to love the taste of this product but unfortunately it gave him bad diarrhea 
product	some cats like it  some don t  the packaging is awful  getting all the contents out without spilling any is very difficult  you have to do it again immediately because there is not enough in the packet to feed a grown cat  running up the price 
product	there were fish with heads attached  was not really expecting that and not really wanting my 12 year old cat to eat bones  it is hard on his digestive system
product	i have a couple finicky cats so i add in a package of this product to moisten the meals   it really helps entice them to eat it all up  problem is with the packaging  a pleated bottom makes it difficult to empty the package  too expensive to be wasteful  i will think twice before ordering again 
product	ordering  shipping  etc    excellent  but     the condition of that case s contents was terrible  virtually all the cans  24  had some sort of dent and or damage  one of the lid tabs even snapped off  had to use can opener  the exterior cardboard box was not damaged  so the cans had to be damaged in storage  once opened  all cans appeared ok  so did not return them  but will return complain if this ever happens again  that case should have never been shipped 
health	my 2 kitties have kidney issues due to the conditions associated to their ripe old age of 17  i have tried different brands but this one by far is most palatable to my guys  i have another young cat  3 years  who when she eats this stuff gets diarrhea  tough to keep them out of each others food bowls  but overall  if you have picky eaters this is the brand to go with  it also does seem to be helping with their issues 
quality	my cat does not eat this food  he just will not eat this kind of food 
quality	i bought both types of the kidney diet and my cat smells it and walks away  she is a small cat 8lbs at 4 years old so she can not afford to lose any weight  i am very disappointed  i wasted almost 80 dollars on a food my cat will not eat  i do not understand why there are not more choices for the kidney care line 
quality	this food was great when i first started using it and my cat loved it  but now they seem to put so many carrots and so much less meat that my cat will not eat it unless i pick out every carrot  well i do and the amount of carrots i pick out is just ridiculous  and this food is super pricey to be getting less meat  clearly they are just trying to save money on meat and load it up with the cheapest ingredient  the carrots i pick out literally fills up half the can  really  you think cats should be eating a diet of mostly carrots  i wish they had another option beside the pate which my cat hates and fish which i will not feed him  so i am going to be switching as soon as i check with my vet on their
quality	the food smells awful  the cat will not eat it  she just sticks her nose up at it  so i have a case of expensive prescription cat food that they will not eat 
quality	but probably good ingredients for my cat with altered kidney function  however he eats it without enjoying it  it is evident  he does not like the taste  previously to be on diet he was fed with dry food from hill s  i have always fed my cat and dogs with hill s food and they had and have the best health results   some french food treats sparingly offered   max the cat is 14 and the dog is 13 
quality	my cat like food that has gravy and this one is good and wet  however he will not eat it unless i mix in his fancy feast food and then he does a good job of picking through it and leave most of this behind 
product	2 of my 4 cats were diagnosed with kidney failure  one is 20 years old  the other is 4 months old   the younger of the two initially devoured this food but his enthusiasm for it decreased with each feeding   the older of the two took a few bites once but now sniffs at it and walks away   however one of my other 2 cats that does not not kidney issues seems to genuinely enjoy it  go figure   and chewy had the best price and fastest delivery  it arrived one day after i ordered it  so i still gave it 3 stars  it should be noted that i also bought the tuna stew  which yielded the same outcome as the chicken stew  as well as the dry kibble which unlike the canned food  went over well with all
quality	my cat who is approaching kd  but not does not have kd yet  seemed to like this food at first  then he would just eat the soupy  gravy part and leave the rest  he will eat pate foods  but also likes flaked tuna and pieces of chicken  so not sure why he will not finish this  looks yummy to me  i am hoping he will take to it again after deciding he does not like his current food  both my cats seem to like something for a while then suddenly dislike it  who knows  i was also prescribed royal canin senior consult  which he liked for a short while and then not  just focusing on any lower protein canned food now 
quality	my vet gave me a can of this food to try  it was soupy with fairly moist chicken pieces in a broth  my cat loved it so i ordered a case of it and the tuna  it turns out they may have changed the recipe  the new food is a totally different texture  somewhere between a mush and a pate  my cat will not even go close to it  so now i have a lot of cat food my cat will not eat 
product	i guess my cat is just too finicky  he loved the sample provided by my vet so i order a case  received product  opened can the next morning and he looked at it like  you do not really think i am going to eat this   he picks at it and then walks away  so disheartening  the cats who do not require a limited kidney diet will eat some of it  but you can tell they are not real enthused either  it is breaking the bank to try and accommodate mr  who  guess i will have to go back to friskies for him and hope for the best 
health	the only reason i am rating this stew so low is because my cat with kidney disease would not eat it  it looks nice  kind of chunky with veggies  another cat might like it  unfortunately mine did not take to it 
quality	our cat refused to eat it  likes the dry version but not this  they really should let you buy a couple cans to test it so you do not get stuck with a case of it 
quality	hills kd does not like the taste   texture   really dislikes the dry royal canin wet ok the dry she really likes spots stew ck great
quality	my kd cat turns his nose up to this  it also does not smell very appealing  so i can understand why he does not like it 
health	this may not be a fair review because my 23 year old did not like it  but since she has been diagnosed with kidney disease  finding something she will eat has been a real problem  this has just been one more in a long line of renal food she will not eat   > 
quality	the ingredients looks good to me but my finicky cat will not eat it  the dr suggested this type of food but the knucklehead likes friskies and the related temptations snack  however he will eat the blue pate indoor chicken entree  if you have any suggestions i would appreciate it  thank you
quality	my cat has been on k d chicken for many years  when i found out k do chicken   vegetable stew  i though she would also love it  unfortunately she refused to eat  i heard that  unlike dogs  cats are pure meat eaters  i truly believe this is true 
quality	or rather  they will not eat this out of the larger bag  the smaller bag was a hit  i do not know if it is a shelf life difference or bag size difference  so i will try and feed to the outdoor tnr tom  mr  bibs and tnr girlfriend  mistress    they might not be so spoiled or picky  i will not order the moderate so again  if i could return for refund i would  big waste of money  these boys are doing well on the royal canin so dry prescription   regular   i have already reordered that    
health	i purchased this upon recommendation from my vet because it is moderate calorie  but it caused constipation in my cat  no sooner i put her back on the original food which was the c d from hills she regulated 
quality	dr  recommended this for my overweight cats  they have been on urinary so for years without issue but they will not eat the moderate calorie food  i will be switching back to the regular urinary so 
product	i just started feeding this to my cats  they seem to like it  ordering and delivery was easy 
product	my cats are not really caring for this brand not sure why but it is ok the get like that
quality	my cat does not like this food  i have to mix it with other treat to make my cat eat it  will not buy it again  do not waste your money                                                                                                                    
product	cans are always crushed  boxes are packed with no regard to contents and there is no cushioning put in so everything slides around 
quality	my cats more likly to eat tender meat or fish must in gravy  not a grinding mooshy stuff  from the first bite they refuse to eat  i always prefer to give them healthy food  i am going crazy to find food for their temptation  i being loosing money buying right food for them 
quality	i thought i try something new instead of the royal canin for my cat  because this has flavors  it says it has gravy but it looks very dry  my cat does not care for it  i keep trying but end up throwing them away 
health	my cat likes this and has not had any urinary tract infections since i started him on it  it is very expensive though because it only comes in the 3oz can  and it costs almost a dollar    89  per can and he weighs almost 15 pounds  next time i will repeat the order so i will get the discount for auto ship 
quality	chewy delivery is outstanding however my cats did not care for the taste of this  ended up giving all of the product away 
quality	indoor cats do not care for it  but the ferals will eat this when they are really hungry  in the morning 
quality	cats would not eat this food  but they are picky  not sure if it is them or the food 
product	i was so hoping my cat would like this but she didn t  she had a uti so i wanted to get her on this to prevent any future problems  i will have to try something else  chewy was great about my refund  no hassle   they are the best 
health	my cat does not like this product and will not eat it  he prefers friskies special diet urinary tract formula little bits chicken canned wet food  he is very fussy about food 
health	my cats do not like it and they vomit when they eat it  i never had that problem before with other food 
quality	my cats did not like this product they only ate a few nibbles then turned their nose up
health	both my cats had projectile vomiting on this food from the start  i stopped it and went back to their other fancy feast and they were fine 
health	not recommended due to exceedingly small portion which consists mostly of gravy  a plethora of very tiny bits of fish  after gravy gone  fish not consumed by licking and the gravy is left to dry out and then looks very dark and unhealthy  i also purchased this formula in the turkey with gravy  same story there  my cats only ate these because of the gravy  which then obviously is well liked  end story is that  in my opinion  dollar value is poor  and food is not fulfilling nor nutritious  my advice is if you are a fancy feast regular   1 read all ingredients  and then pick the best formula available  i only use ff to give variety  having said that  i most regularly provide both wet and dry top dollar
quality	my older cat needs a kidney diet  but lost interest in this food after a month  it is very smelly as well and must be taken up after about 20 minutes or my whole house stinks
product	this was very expensive and kitty barely touched it  she was already underweight and lost more weight because she wasn’t eating this  i switched back to friskies wet food which she’s eating and is now gaining back some weight 
quality	my cat with newly diagnosed early esrd will not touch any variety of hill s k d wet cat food  i have tried mixing it with the stinkiest non good for them food like fancy feast or friskies  and even then  the merest whif of k d and she turns and walks away 
health	my cat s been on urinary food for three years  but his kidney disease has progressed enough that our vet says he needs to be on kidney food now  he does not like it  and will not eat it    
quality	my cats really liked the prescription diet foods when i first started feeding them with the two flavors i ordered  but within days they were bored and refusing to eat it  so i had to supplement with other foods not as good for them  i need more flavors  but chewy only listed two flavors 
quality	i have a picky cat  he likes the gravy in the k d wet cat food  but he will not eat any of the solid chunks  i have tried all flavors to no avail 
quality	my 17 year old cat has kidney problems we just found out about when i took him in for a dental appt  the doctor says he is going to have to be on the kidney care food for the rest of his life  i happily ordered the canned food for him  he usually loves it  obviously  he does not like the vegetables so much  he refuses to eat it  oh well  i will try one that is not a  stew  and donate the expensive food he hates to the vet 
quality	the cat does not like this  i purposely selected this choice because 1  our cat only eats fish flavors  no poultry or other meats   and 2  this was a less expensive option on your offerings  i wish you offered more flavors  consider a variety pack offering  i also wish you offered smaller packages for purchase so i could test out what our cat would eat  it is frustrating and expensive to have to buy a whole case to find out she will not eat any of it 
quality	at the recommendation of the vet  i bought this for our older cat with mild kidney failure issues  but he will not touch it  we have a chubby younger cat that will eat anything  and she will not touch it either   she will not even taste it  i am sure this is very good high quality food  but the presence of vegetables in the food or something else is turning them off 
quality	my cats will not eat this food  i have to try and find something different 
quality	i am sure this is a wonderful product  but if your cat will not eat it  then it is not helping 
quality	not sure what to do kassie will not eat the food  she has left me with a case off food 
quality	they did but will not touch the chunks  going to the shelter with the sheba cuts  unfortunately 
quality	my cat never tried it before and does not like it  so we went to pet store to get something else 
quality	half the product is creamy as advertised and my cats like it but the other half is not creamy and my cats will not eat it and i have 6 cats and non would touch cans without cream 
quality	i am sure there are some cats that like this food  but my cats did not care for it  i will now donate it to the animal shelter 
quality	my cats are so picky and did not care for the creamy delights food 
quality	i have four cats  one is very picky about the texture and will not eat the pate type  this variety pack has pate  and the salmon and tuna have larger chunks  cat food producers need to realize  that like dogs  cats do not always chew their food  they tend to eat too fast  and it will all come back up if it is not minced or in smaller bites 
quality	did not realize this was pate and filets because my kitty does not care for the pate so now i have to see if my neighbor s cat will eat it  otherwise  it was as described 
product	thought from the packaging that my cats would love this food  they nibble at first and then let it sit    the longer it sat    the funkier it got   i m going to donate the remains of the 2 cases i bought to an animal selter
quality	three out of my five house cats really like it and eat all 3 flavors  the other two will not eat any of it  my outside feral loves the turkey and salmon but will not eat the chicken flavor  i do not know what the difference is  because it smells and looks exactly like ff  but  cats are cats  it is a good deal  but i would gladly pay more to get something they all will eat 
product	the only one my cat will eat is the pate beef  waste of money for me 
health	was really hopeful for tiny tiger   i like the smaller cans along with variety and pate style food for my senior cat  although grain free is not desirable as far as i am concerned   unfortunately  tiny tiger makes two of my cats projectile vomit about 15 20 minutes after eating so i will have to find somewhere to donate the rest and try another new brand for picky boy 
quality	both our cats would not eat this and they’re not picky  we gave it to 2 friend’s cat   one also wouldn’t go near it and another liked it  i wouldn’t buy it again  we donated the rest to a shelter 
quality	my cats would not eat this brand of cat food cannot even get a couple of strays to eat it
quality	i tried this variety pack so i could see which proteins my cat likes before i ordered all of one kind  he licked the gravy and then refused to eat any of them  i even tried chopping up the pate patty into little pieces for him  and he still wouldn’t eat it 
quality	i have three and none of them touched it  they sniffed it and walked away  i bought a case so i’ll have to donate it to the shelter 
quality	bought this brand as well as american journey when they were both in a bogo sale  i learned my cats did not much care for it compared to the american journey  they also seem to not care for pate as much as minced and in gravy  none of the flavors from this brand were a hit  the first few went completely untouched  they eventually came around to it a bit but i think the clear winner out of the 4 packs i bought was the minced  gravy american journey  the outside cats raccoon seemed to like it  the dog did as well  that might be setting the bar too low though  all joking aside if you are starting a cat off on this brand you are probably not gonna have trouble  if you have a cat that is picky i
quality	my inside and outside cats both hated this  refused to eat it  however the dog loved it
quality	my 2 girls are fussy and sniffed it and walked away  i would not spend that much money again  bought orange   yellow boxes  unless there was a sample size box 
quality	first time my cats have refused to eat food  will keep trying other brands  chewy com is wonderful  this product just did not make my cats happy 
quality	not one cat touched either of these flavors  even the cats that mostly eat anything i set down walked away  one tried to bury the beef 
quality	i have two cats  one of which was a rescue from the streets  he devours anything in his path  but this food he had very little interest in  in fact  only a few bites would be taken between two cats  and not touched again  and they did this no matter what the flavor  so i am not sure why it is not appealing  but i am sure my two furkids give it evil looks and snub it 
quality	my furkids gave this a thumbs down  they took a sniff and walked away from their bowls 
quality	we tried the new food  unfortunately all three cats do not like it  most of it is being thrown out  even the two feral cats outside do not like it  sorry
quality	i got this food because chewy was out of stock of normal food  the foods texture is never the same even when it’s the same meat  it’s some times very soupy while other times it’s very dense like a load of bread  i have a cat who will eat anything i give him  and he turned his nose up at this and refused to eat it  sadly i bought two boxes thinking it would be great  but i was mistaken  it also has little to no smell which is difficult to believe since cats rely on smell to eat  all in all would definitely never rebuy 
quality	at first my cats seemed to enjoy something different but after a couple cans in   they really did not care for it  i do not think there is anything wrong with the product  it is just not for them 
quality	i have had to throw away quite a few cans due to the  easy open can  not opening and my can opener cannot open something that small  the cats do like the food but the mom hates wasting it due to improper opening not opening  please fix the opener to this can 
quality	i purchased the tiny tiger cat food while it was on sale  my cat is finnicky about her food  but i thought i would let her try something different  she has refused to eat it after multiple attempts  luckily i did not spend a lot of money to let her try it out  i will not be purchasing this product again 
quality	good quality and price  but they will not eat it  one taste and they walk away 
quality	out of my 8 cats  not one of them would eat this  it does not have a pleasant look or smell  so i can see why they turn their noses up at it 
quality	my boys are definitely on the picky side  so i know i was taking my chances with this based on reviews  they wouldn’t even try this product  one sniff and they both walked away 
quality	i bought this brand when they offered bogo awhile back  well  they can keep it  seafood variety was putrid and the cats will not eat this flavor once opened and in the refrigerator  this case going to the local humane society like the seafood case 
quality	my big boy persian did not care for this food  the two persian kittens loved it  but not as much as another grain free  i appreciated trying it for a half price special 
product	cannot complain as i chanced this as it was half priced  but will not buy again as it was not a winner with the kitties 
product	not a great favorite   did eat some  probably will not buy again 
quality	got a great deal on black friday  bogo free but my cats do not like half the varieties 
product	i was more excited about the discount and should have read the ingredients list before purchasing  this contains meat by products  very disappointed  i am sure the local shelter cats will enjoy this  though 
quality	my cat would not go near this  donated to a shelter 
quality	5 out of 5 cats would not eat them and 1 out of 2 dogs would not eat them 
quality	wanted to try this because my cats are old and are starting to show signs of potential renal problems  they will not eat this treat 
quality	i bought these treats to go with the dry food of the same brand  that the vet prescribed for my kitty  she will not even touch them  so i will just throw them away 
quality	good product my cat do not like them though wish came in other flavors more desirable
quality	and here i thought it was just my 3 cats  that turned their nose up to several fancy feast fish flavors   but read some of the reviews and other pet parents said their fur babies disliked it too   fancy feast was a big hit with my cats now it just a waste of money     
quality	does not care for this flavor salmon   shrimp from fancy feast i will not be buying it again
quality	i served this cat food to my two cats  half a can on each  they ate it  although not usually finishing it  after a week  they just smell it and would not eat anymore  i alternate their food with other fancy feast flavor  and i hope that they will eat this salmon   shrimp pate when i feed it to them again in about a month 
quality	my cats did not really care for this too much  one will not touch it and the other one will only eat a little of it
health	my cats cannot eat this because it has  hairball control   it makes them vomit 
quality	i thought he would like it but he will not touch it  so i order meow mix and he likes that with thumbs up  i have a whole bag of cat food that he will not eat 
product	they eat it when there is nothing else but they do not really seem to like it 
product	this is one of the best of the inexpensive dry cat foods  but i still mix it with premium cat food  nutro  in a 50 50 mix 
quality	we tried this and out kitties do not like it  idk of it is taste or what  but they will not eat this food 
quality	this review to for purina only    nothing to do with chewy com    we have been buying this product for years   recently  the last few bags have been getting have been low quality salmon morsals  what we have been getting is tiny pieces of the salmon morsals  it literally looks like the morsals exploded in the bag  i contacted purina one and the did say they they did make a  minor change  to the ingredients  minor change  that is our cats favorite part of the dry food   just want to give you all a heads up on buying this product  you will not be getting what is listed on the packaging  here is the email i received  thank you for contacting nestlé purina petcare company regarding your
quality	something about the chicken he loved but kashmir does not like this salmon
quality	i have 3 cats  1 cat rescue dumped on us  said she would have a home in a week and 2 years later they have forgotten she exists    and i help my mom with her    6  8  do not even recall the count anymore    so we have a lot of cats  and unfortunately  they are pretty costly  this food is an average product in my book and suitable to fill in the gaps when the monthly bills are more than expected but the cats need to eat  pros   very tasty  my kids are spoiled with royal canin  taste of the wild  which i do not actually like but they do and it is a more expensive brand   dave s    etc  so when i offered this and there were zero qualms  it was a relief  i hated going a step down but since my mom
quality	chewy is great to work with  occasionally  an item will be missing  but is sent immediately  the above product  i have 4 cats and all 4 would not eat any of it  i recommend chewy all of the time  prices are comparable and your order is at your door almost the very next day 
quality	my cats are picky and bored easily  that is why i order so many different flavors  they did not seem too fond of this one but if desperate they will eat it  also  is there a dry food you could recommend for picky indoor cats  i used to mix it up and give them the iams indoor proactive health  but now they will not touch it and if they do will throw it back up later in the day 
product	cats loved the taste  there were about 6 cans in the shipment that were dented  outside packaging did not show any damage
quality	our cats won’t eat cat food where blobby chunks of gluten substitute for meat  so i bought this salmon “pate” as a change of pace  i offered the first can to two cats who sniffed  ate for a while  then walked away  what was left in the bowl  blobby chunks of gluten  just cut smaller than in that other brand  i had thought fancy feast was high quality  after all  it costs more than twice as much per pound than friskies  say  but now i feel like a sucker   p s  i see flaked chicken and tuna is the same  i’ll be watching for others  
quality	we have been loyal fans of fancy feast for almost 25 years  since january of 2018 our two 15 year old cats stopped eating their flavors  these guys started eating it when they were 3 months old  as an old cat mom  i see more color to the foods and as my guys are gluten sensitive  i wonder if nestle is adding more in as they have to all of the other purina brand foods  what a shame  i have a kidney cat and the lack of the fancy feast pate now is a real problem   
quality	i’m not sure if ff changed their recipe for this flavor  or if i’m simply dealing with a suddenly finicky cat  but my kitty took one sniff of the salmon classic flavor and walked away  the cat adoption agency here is going to get a nice cat food donation 
health	my older cats throw up after they eat  one eats too fast   the other is 12 years old  once i rotate this in  they both stop throwing up  i have gotten this kind before   it works 
health	i hesitate to write this review because after reading all the positive reviews  i think i must have gotten a bad bag  i recently changed to this brand of cat food as i was having a problem with cats throwing up  i was buying smaller bags at a local store near me and as my cats seemed to like the taste and throwing up problem improved  i decided to order larger bags from chewy since i am a regular customer and have several cats  first  when i opened the new larger bag  it had an odor i did not like and my smaller bags did not have  then  i compared the kibble to the kibble from a smaller bag  not the same color  final test  i filled some cat bowls and cats came running  sniffed the food
health	but it still has junk in it  my cats are now on a no gmo  no by product  no meal product  no corn or gluten diet of fresh food  when my cats ate this it did not help my cat s skin allergy because it was severe but my cats did like the taste of it 
quality	it may be because my cats are spoiled  but one actually tried her best to cover the food  even the kittens  rescued  would not go near it 
quality	my cat  like any cat  is a picky eater  sometimes he eats a new food for a few days and then decides that he does not like it  this is the first time in 12 years that tomás did not eat anything at all not even one bit 
quality	we were told by our vet to switch from grain free due to the heart issues showing up in pets  okay  my cat loved the blue wilderness with chicken   we discontinued it  now no matter what i have bought   fed her  she will not eat it  my guess is that she wants to eat meat  i have fed her regular canned food   she walks away from it  i am not sure of what kind of food to buy now 
health	i was really hoping this would work for my cat with the sensitive stomach  but she hated it and none of the other cats wanted it either 
quality	my cats all refused to eat this food  such a waste
health	i have four cats that are not particularly picky about their food  none of them like this food and when they do eat it they throw up  my four month old puppy that loves to get into the cat food will not even touch this stuff 
health	madeline was bored with her food  but needed sensitive stomach food  she is enjoying the blue buffalo food we ordered 
quality	my cats would not eat this even though the price was reasonable
product	the feral cats eat this  but my 2 house kitties won t  i ordered a much less expensive brand and they love that  plus theit tummies are happy now 
health	my kitty vomits her food quite often  i thought this food for sensitive stomachs would be good for her  but  she will not eat it  i even mixed it with warm water  she will not go near it      
health	this cat food definitely sold me right away when i found it online  just the eye catching pink color and the sensitive recipe featured on the bag  it was exactly what i was looking for for my cats  because they were having bad diarrhea  anyways bought the food and when i got it it was very small round pebbles and very healthy smelling  i knew they were not going to like it  it took them a couple days to finally try it and then they started to get used to it  now they seem to finish their portions and are okay with it  it seemed to help their stomach problems possibly  going to give it more time 
quality	my 2 cats will not eat this food  they barely even sniff it  i was hoping they would like it because it seems like a good quality food 
health	this did not work for either of our kitties  one refused to eat it and the other one has been eating and vomiting relentlessly  i realize every cat is different  just not for us 
health	i am sure this is an excellent food for some cats  but it made my two sick  after the first bout with throwing up i stopped feeding it to them  then started again about a month later  with the same throwing up results  they also will not eat the blue buffalo soft treats  today  i gave the rest of the bag to a friend who has 6 cats  hopefully their cats can tolerate it  i will stick to my usual food  which they can keep down 
health	my cat vomits this food because of those life source bits  vet said because you can not control how many he gets it up sets his tummy  so if you have a cat with tummy issues do not get this food
quality	this was prescribed for urinary care  but my cat turns his nose up at it  which is frustrating  i am sure it is a fine product  but you cannot force them to eat what they will not eat  just based on that  i cannot recommend 
quality	the wet food is pork based with other items added in  my cats would not eat any of it 
health	my male cat who is 11 years old was having urinary difficulties  my vet gave him antibiotics and recommended this food  i had to buy a case as that is only how it is sold  my cat s did not care much for it  i was not happy with the amount of junk in it that is not good for cats  artificial flavors  grains  how can hill s think that this is good for a sick cat   here is the ingredient list  ocean fish  brewers rice  cracked pearled barley  corn gluten meal  wheat gluten  brown rice  chicken fat  chicken meal  chicken liver flavor  whole grain oats  lactic acid  calcium sulfate  flaxseed  fish oil  potassium chloride  powdered cellulose  choline chloride  l lysine  dl methionine  potassium
product	i am disappointed in this product  i had to buy all the 24 cans and my kitties hate it  wish i could have tried a few cans first  maybe i can return some cans  i will check 
product	this food would be great if the ingredients were better  it’s way overpriced for the amount of junk in it  only blue buffalo has quality ingredients in their prescription food 
product	i have 5 cats  only one will touch it  very expensive and disappointed 
quality	my cat does not want to eat it and she has eaten it in the past  a few days ago we found what looked like a dead round worm in the food  i think this batch of food somehow got contaminated  i am not 100  sure but now that she will not even touch the food makes me think something is wrong with it 
quality	my 4 cats do not like this food  male cat should be eating it because of recurring problems  he does not like it   i am not crazy about the ingredients  i wish we could fnd somthing we both like to help his urinary health
quality	my cat loves the stews by hill s prescription diet  but hated this   would not go near it  and now i have wasted over  25 on a case of food he will not eat  
health	i have 2 male cats and 1 female cat and the only cat who will consistently eat the canned food is the female  my two male cats will eat the hard food but one suffered from extreme constipation even though he drank lots of water and died yesterday while under sedation trying to remove the blockage  my remaining male cat prefers shredded cat food in juice and will not touch the stews or ground foods that hills offers  i have resorted to trying another all natural cat food in a pouch that is in pumpkin juice and is fairly low in phosphorus and sodium   59 to  9 compared to hill s  5  i want him to not live on just hard food like his brother did 
product	one of the packages had a can that was open     it smelled terrible   not sure i will order again  it turned me off 
quality	for the past six months  the 12 pack cans advertise 3 flavors  the past 6 8 boxes i have bought have all had the three flavors advertised but all the cans contained the same food  i am about to switch food because what the label says is not in the can  poor quality control  or i should say  none at all 
quality	oscar my cat is in renal failure  i purchased royal canin renal support d based on the review of others  unfortunately he will not eat it 
quality	unfortunately my very picky diva cat didn’t like it  she took one smell and walked away  i was sure that she would like it since it has gravy but was wrong  wish i could have bought just a couple of cans instead of a case  will donate to animal shelter 
quality	unfortunately my cats will not eat it  i have switched to science diet k d 
health	my 18 yo cat has kidney disease and would not eating any of the food for kidney problems  she will eat this  however still not very much 
quality	i have 2 elderly cats that have done well for the last year on the royal canin renal diet formula d  canned   with a recent new order both cats are refusing to eat it  has the formula been changed 
quality	my cat would not eat this food  she was in kidney failure and only ate this food a few times before she stopped and would not eat it any more  a few days later she got a rehydration treatment  but still died 2 days after that 
quality	my cat does not like it  if he does not change his mind i will not be ordering it again 
quality	my cat will not eat it  i am wondering if the gravy  component was left out 
health	my cat has kidney disease  this is the only wet food i have found she will eat  she just likes the sauce  unfortunately  royal changed the formula and the sauce is virtually non existent  but at least there is a small amount she can have and she does eat the dry food  the service department did an outstanding job of sending it to me in 2 days 
quality	i was so happy to find royal canin for my cat with kidney issues  two different formulas  and two sized cans  she liked them for a few weeks but  unfortunately  she now refuses to eat  she waits all night  will not eat  and i then give her the typical fancy feast for breakfast which she will eat  same thing for days  i cannot afford for her to eat only one meal a day  and not a kidney formula at that    i tried all other brands  kidney diets and  luckily  she does eat the purina for some reason  therefore  i give her regular food in the morning and kidney formula at nite  the vet is not pleased  but what can i do if she will not eat the other brands    she always has been used to a large variety of
product	suuuuper expensive especially vs the c d regular  just because my cat is stressed that means i have to be also    and just fyi these are the small cans  i wish this was available in the larger cans at a more reasonable price  my cat does not seem to like it much  was actually on the y d for 6 months before and ate it better though i think there is some extenuating circumstances that makes her not that hungry anyways  i will not go into it  also does not seem to be helping her urinating stress at all after 3 weeks so   eh
quality	buy this product  my eater ate it but not enthusiastically  my other cat did not touch it  besides the fact that the can had half as much food as the regular can  chewy  you really should make this evident  i thought the food was cheaper with veggies  my bad  i agree  i have to be more careful 
health	my cat has been on c d for about a year now with no problems  the last case i bought seems to have something wrong with it  i will open a can that is very watery and dark is brown and smells very very strong  then i will open another can of the same case and it will be the normal color and consistency  if i try to give the smelly  watery one to my cat she turns her nose up or she will take a few bites then vomit  this does not ever happen with i get the normal looking can out for her  i am not sure if j could have purchased a bad case or what  but i have had to thrown out roughly 14 cans of food because of this  i love this brand but am very disappointed in the last case i purchased 
quality	my cat would not eat it  total waste of money  perhaps she did not like the texture of the meat  i bought it because it said for the most finicky cats
health	we have purchased this for years for our cats ranging in age from 1 13 and in the last few months they have turned their nose up at it  my 13 year old starting having some health issues so i looked at what might have changed in his environment  we had noticed the texture of the new packages was different than the old ones  much chunkier meat and different gravy texture   out of curiosity i called purina and they did confirm that in february 2018 the recipe was changed  i let them know that my cats would no longer eat it  i am in the process of finding a new brand of food for my guys  hope this helps anyone else having similar disgruntled cats lol 
quality	this cat food is not the best nor the worst but my cat will eat it easily  i supplement his diet with high quality dry food products  i have tried more expensive higher quality wet food and my cat will not eat those types of food  switched back to this because it has some nutrition and he will eat it  he prefers dry but i try to limit dry due to excessive carbs
quality	looks different and cats do not like it as well  trying one more time  cat has eaten it for months until looks changed 
quality	i have four rescue cats who always fight and gobble this brand down in no time this batch none of them will even go near it which i found odd i smelled it and it smells funny and has a funny looking color to it  i have been a customer for sometime and spent a lot of money but lately the quality and service have declined  i m sorry to say  i may pay more but i think its time to go back to fosters and smith
quality	i have read quite a lot of reviews on this food here on chewy  i am experiencing the same thing  i have fed this particular food for years as i have one cat who will only eat this type  she will no longer touch it and the other 8 will not eat it either  it is now brown instead of pink  no shrimp and smells horrible  i have purchased from chewy as well as petsmart  my most recent purchases have been from petsmart  three different cases which were all nasty  i called purina and they said there was no change in the formula  this cannot be true  this stuff is gross  i do want to point out that it is not chewy s issue  it is purina s  i went into consumer reports to write a review and
quality	my cat does not like this foodit is not chewies problem that my cat doesn’t like the food i have tried mixing it with other foods that he likes but he refuses to eat it i will donate it to the shelters here
health	makes my cat sick everytime she eats it she throws up 
quality	this catfood stinks  it made the whole house smells like old shrimp the cats would not eat either  i would not recommend buying this product  we buy several of the other varieties of this brand  they do not smell strongly and the cats love them but will never buy this flavor again 
quality	this used to be the only wet food my two picky himalayans would eat  now they will not touch it and i am in a quandary about what to buy them  the food used to have a decent texture and consistency  now it looks like it is full of garbage and unground bones  it is a horrible grey color and is full of oil  i do not blame them for not wanting to eat it  i have contacted purina several times about this but all i get is more coupons and apologies  i just want a decent food for my cats  i think they must have changed suppliers or started buying a cheaper type of fish  i am disappointed because i have always fed purina to my pets 
quality	this food was picked as a replacement for classic savory salmon which my cat was slow eating  she definitely does not like the flaked food so i will go back to the salmon  other cats may love this but i can only go by my cats reaction 
product	for some reason bella dislikes this batch of fish   shrimp feast  unfortunately i bought a whole case for her  i will have to give them away  i do not know if this was a bad batch or if she is suddenly extra fussy   she loves to eat   she will eat other fancy feasts  though 
quality	it looks like fresh fish  i thought my cats would love it  but they will not touch it 
quality	i do not know what happens to canned cat food from wharehouse shippers  i can get a case of this food from a local petstore and my cats like it  but when i buy by the case from chewy s or amazon  they will not eat it  maybe it sits too long  too cold  too hot  i do not know  but i ordered two cases of canned fancy feast from chewy s and my cats will not eat any of these cans 
quality	we had one cat that really seemed to like this  and although i hated to even open the can since it smelled so strong  i bought it occasionally for him  now he has decided he does not like it any longer  anyone else have cats like that    
health	my 5 year old cat couldn’t stomach this food  vomiting after first try  mixed with his other food to introduce even slower put eat around it  a whole bag waisted 
health	my cats  and many of my friend s cats  appear to have an allergy or intolerance for wet or dry cat food made with chicken  however  no vomiting with fish flavored food or treats  while i appreciate purina one working to help cat s urinary function  without requiring a prescription   i am unable to continue purchasing this product as my cats do not tolerate it well  i would be willing to try it again  if they use fish instead of chicken 
quality	my two cats have eaten this food for several years and has worked well  no more uti problems   now they will not eat it  did the formula change on this cat food   
quality	my cat is a very picky eater  will not eat this  will try another kind  love chewy  will keep trying other products
health	i bought this food after spending a lot of money for a sick cat with urinary problems  we tried 3 kinds of urinary food  science diet which he does not like  royal canin which he likes but i cannot afford and purina one which i was hoping all of our kitties would eat  none of them like this food snubbed big time and now i do not know what to feed him  he does however like the wet purina urinary food  not enough of a variety of urinary foods and normal people cannot afford to pay the prices much less the expensive vet bills 
quality	i tried two purina one foods and not one of my 4 cats would try it  they smelled and walked away 
health	they love the hair ball flavor of purina one but had zero interest in eating the urinary tract flavor  they need the urinary tract version and have been eating another purina brand but i decided to switch it up to give them something new after 5 years  big mistake  do not know what to do with the full 16 pound bag   wish i could get my   back 
quality	my cats eats royal cane urinary so that is a prescription food  i was browsing on chewy site and find this one i went ahead and purchase it my three indoor cats did not like it one of the cats did not eat it at all the two other they were eating some of it finally i gave it friend of mine who feed some stray cats and the did not eat it at all   chewy refunded me  
health	i bought this food because i was hoping for a food that has urinary support but this food is full of grain and my cats started vomiting
quality	i have 3 cats and wanted to try this because of uti problems  they would not eat this  they are not typically picky either  i rely heavily on product reviews when i buy a new product  so i though others might need to know my experience before they try it 
health	i just adopted a 10 year old cat  i was told that she has had urinary crystals in the past  i was really hopeful that purina one would be a good choice  i read all the positive reviews  since day one  my cat just vomits right after eating purina one  this has been going on for days  i had to put her on albacore tuna just to settle her stomach  now  i am stuck with 1 1 2 16 pound bags of purina one 
quality	my cat has only had dry food his entire life and does not get treats ever  he does not eat wetfood ever and he really avoided eating this specific catfood at all cost  i originally purchased it since it is very low in sodium and is a healthier option versus many of the other dry catfoods available on the market  he meowed at me for days because he wanted his old food  he even picked his old food out in the bottom of the bowl to avoid eating this new food  he is not happy  however  it seems that he is finally relenting and realizing i am not giving him anything else  my recommendation is to hold out and when your cat gets hungry enough he will eventually eat it  i do not know if it would work for
quality	so far  none of my 6 cats  including an outside semi feral one  will eat this food  they have eaten other purina one types of food  including dry  but this one i may have to give away to animal control  it is been 5 days and they will barely touch it  cats vote with their mouths  and can go on a  hunger strike  for what seems like weeks  but this crowd shows no sign of breaking their fast  it seems axiomatic  but any type of food that i buy in bulk is the type they usually decide they do not like  multiple cat owners  caveat emptor  buy small amounts of catfood if you are trying something new 
health	my cats really love fancy feast chicken pate and the grilled chicken  however both cats threw up the turkey and giblets within 15 minutes  the rest of the case sits on the shelf 
product	i have nothing against the product  but i would have preferred it arrived undented and without the product oozing out of the cans  i would complain to customer service but it seems to have fallen to its lowest levels ever 
quality	i am sure this is perfectly fine fancy feast  but my two do not like it  back to salmon  tuna and chicken for them  nothing wrong with the product  they just turned up their catnoses and walked away  i will not order it again  but you can try it on your purr mongers 
product	my one cat that i intended this food for would not even take a bite of it  i proceeded to try it on my other 2 cats and they nibbled on it but that is about it and they were clearly disappointed as they always finish their fancy feast cans  i have been using many flavors of ff cat food and always to try new ones to give my cats variety but this one is a complete bust  
quality	this food was recommended by our vet for our cat who has digestive problems  she will not eat it at all  not plain  not mixed with wet food  she would rather starve  i plan on requesting a refund 
health	in spite of not being a fan  she eats it because she has to eat hydrolyzed food  she has severe food allergies and this food does not have any of them  her body can metabolize this food 
health	i am sad to say my cat will not touch this food  i switched her over to it and she will not eat  i took her to the vet for not eating  raked up a huge bill for blood work  and the diagnosis  my cat does not like her new food  wish i could get my money back 
health	my cat had to eat this food according to the vet  and there are very limited options for this type of food  however  the general quality of the food is not up to par with what my cats eat now  and the one who supposedly had to eat this food for his stomach has actually been doing much better on regular food that is of a higher ingredient quality  i am torn on what to say to other people though  because if you have a cat with digestion issues it can be nerve wracking trying different things to see if kitty can keep them down  if possible i would recommend trying something else 
health	my cat has a food allergy  he has only had pea and venison  since royal canin stopped making pv i had to find a substitute  this hp was not a substitute  after eating it for about a week he started to chew up his body again  thank goodness chewy came up with a real substitute for the royal canin pv and saved the day 
health	my cat has skin issue from what they say is food allergy but he hates this food  tried several but he is not liking any  
health	having used this brand of cat food for years for our diabetic cat and having such good results we were hoping for the success with our cat that has allergies  so sorry to say he will not eat it at all  i certainly wish it was more appealing in the taste department so he could reap the benefits of helping with his issues  apparently not the answer for us 
quality	two of my cats  who are not too picky  will not eat this food  it does not have a scent or flavor that draws them to it  one of my cats is a senior who is missing teeth  because this kibble is very small  he cannot pick it up and chew it  he tries  but ends up swallowing those that he does manage to pick up whole  i bought 2 bags and i am going to take them to the local animal shelter 
product	cats will only eat if they are really hungry  will not buy again
quality	tried to make the gradual transition over from friskies seafood dry kibble that she’s eaten for 9 years  took two bites of this initially  and refuses to eat anymore  good thing i ordered the smallest bag 
quality	my cat hates this food  another full bag of food my cat will not eat 
quality	my cats do not like this flavor either and have barely touched it  i will be donating the rest of it and having to order a different brand 
health	will go back to the iam s hair ball because oth have lost weight which
quality	my cats would not touch it the tinned food did not do any better 
quality	okay so my are will ray just about anything you give him  i want to switch him to this grain free food and instead of chicken i wanted him to try salmon because he loves fish  he ate it for the first 2 days but now he just turns his nose up to it  he usually screams and chases me around the house until i put more food in his bowl  but it is almost like he would rather starve than eat this food  i am giving it 2 stars because i do like the ingredients even though my cat does not and i love that the bag is velcro  but it has a very strong smell and sometimes the bag does not like to close  but now i have a full bag of cat food that is not going to be used 
quality	we have 7 kitties and not one of them will touch this  i bought the dry and the wet because some of our cats prefer wet food and they will not eat it in either form  even our 15 pounder who will normally eat anything will not touch it  pretty disappointed 
quality	we have multiple cats who eat via a free feed container  now our babies are piggies and will normally devour anything  this was the case at first with this food  i chose this food because it was an affordable  grain free  non chicken  alternative  i subscribed for autoship and thought one less thing to worry about  nope  while they ate it at first  the longer it was in the container  they would not touch it  i have never had issues before because the containers are designed for pet food and are pretty air tight  they nibbled through the first bags  but now will not eat it  this is crazy  these little brats will eat plastic but they will not touch the food  i am not sure what the reason was but i
product	i own 7 cats   they like it but they do not gobble it down like they do the  cheaper grain  foods for 1 3 the cost  i purchase those cheaper bags to offset the outrageous price manufacturers charge for these grain free brands  it kills me   i purchase expensive no grain  the best dry food and many times their noses are up  my feline group is made up of 4 persians and 3 longhairs  for the high price  and so so reaction  only 3 stars 
quality	some days he loves it and others he refuses to eat it  doesn’t seem to matter which flavor 
product	my cats love the actual broth and will eat the tuna if i crush it into smaller bits  but there is nothing i can do to make the chicken palatable  it is stringy and tough and it is hard to imagine what part of the chicken purina is using  i have eaten white meat from the backs of hens that was not this tough  it is a very expensive way to get a little broth for your cats 
product	i am sorry that i bought them  you get a bunch of almost empty bags  each filled with a dribble of soup  they are a total ripoff 
quality	this is the first friskie product  and there have been so many    that 9 out of 9 cats refused to eat  i have no idea why  as they have refused to comment  i thought it looked enticing  but then again  i did not sample it 
quality	not good my cats will not touch it  i kept trying to fed them friskies tender crunchy dry food but they refused to eat it
quality	bought this in july for my 2 cats to try and they would not even touch it  have not tried it yet and its mid october  even when the other food bowl is empty they will not have any of this stuff  now i need to buy a new bag of the food they love  friskies surfin    turfin  favorites  and find a local shelter to donate this stuff to  
product	this was the favorite for years  they all loved the crunchy and the nice tender chewy pieces  it was like getting their kibble mixed with treats  whatever they did to the recipe  they need to change it back  all the chewy pieces and hard  and the smallest round pieces apparently taste awful because they are left in all the bowls  i feed this to the stray animals outside  i first thought the bag was old and stale  but the date was recent and no tears or wholes in the bag  when i opened the 2nd bag  it was the same  i will not buy it anymore 
health	my raccoon friends love it  i use it as a treat for my indoor cats  who are fed iams instead  when they eat friskies  they throw up more  resulting in stained rugs  because of the dyes  
quality	so far only crunchy no tenders  my older cat cannot eat it 
quality	i have 3 cats  young   middle aged   geriatric   they ate some at first  but subsequently would not touch this 
quality	this is excellent cat food but our cats refuse to eat it    until we open a can of another flavor  then they eat both flavors    and laugh about it    to my face    
quality	this shipment of fancy feast arrived dried and seemingly unappetizing  our two cats are not eating this shipment 
product	sadly  my cats do not really prefer this food  they eat it  but they do not really finish a whole bowl like they did  i figured i would try it to fatten my kitten up to be spayed  but they just do not really prefer it  so back to the old food we go  it was worth a try
quality	i have two 7 yr  old siamese cats  they are very selective in all things  they were not interested in eating this food  but on a positive note  both my dogs loved it 
quality	i have been trying and try to get my cats to eat this food  it is been almost a month now and they still do not like it  i did not have money to buy different food until now  they only eat a little bit every 2 or so days they have both been very upset with me   i have used this food before and they have liked it but now i can not get them to eat it  i guess i will just throw it away when i get different food 
quality	i was really looking forward to switching my cat to this food  not only has a high content of protein and is grain free  but is also made with very good ingredients and has a reasonable price  he started his grain free diet with american journey s chicken and turkey recipe  which he was getting bored of  he got bored of friskies canned food before that and only wanted to eat dry food   so i thought it was the perfect chance to switch him to this one  i started the transition mix  he ate it the first 3 days  when you mix 75 25   but now that the mix is 50 50  he will not go near the bowl  he starves the whole day if he has to  i tried presenting both foods to him and he ended up going for american
health	be advised before purchasing that even though this sounds like a perfect cat food  high protein  grain free  it may not be perfect for your cat  my cat barely picks at the food  and what she does eat comes out the other end as runny diarrhea  switching dry foods asap  i reccomend strongly that you try one of the smaller bags before taking a big plunge on this product 
quality	our cat  who eats everything in sight  does not like this food  he only eats it because it is all he has  never have i seen him leave food in his bowl before  he calls me into the kitchen  looks at the bowl  then at me  then cries like there is something wrong with it 
quality	they snub their noses at it  the ingredients are not too bad although there seems to be too many vegetables in it  i wanted to try it bc it was cheaper for a grain free food  but it does not matter if they will not eat it 
quality	i bought the venison   salmon version for my kittens when they were 8 months old and they would not eat it  they like salmon wet food very much so i was surprised  i ended up feeding it to stray cats 
quality	my mother house cat must be too spoiled for i got her a bag of this since it had alot great reviews and good quality as well  he refused to eat  what a stinker so we went back to what he was previous on 
quality	though the quality of this food is top notch my cats all 7 really did not care for it  i bought it for the higher content of protein but if they do not eat it it really does not matter how much protein it has   
product	even though this is a good product  i have a very picky cat that is not real thrilled with this product  there are very few foods that he will eat 
health	may be superior product  but my 16   male r blue did not like nor eat for several days and threw up gave him the blue indoor w  chicken ate a whole cup like a dog
health	i usually use nutro products with my cats  chicken and rice  i tried this salmon flavor and most of my cats do not like it  this is a very good product  it could just be the flavor they do not like  i do feed this brand to my dogs  i have researched cancer due to losing two rottweillers to their nemesis  bone cancer  i have my rottie and pittie on call of the wild bison and venison flavor to help with cancer prevention because of the ingredients  i may try the chicken flavor next time on the cats 
health	i wanted to switch my cats to grain free  and this food was highly recommended  i bought a small bag at my local pet store to do the switchover  my cats seemed to love it  when the switch was almost complete  i ordered a jumbo bag  since switching to this food  my sphynx has developed very loose stools  it is the only change to her diet  so i have to believe it is caused by this food  i am still determined to improve their diet  but taste of the wild will not be part of it 
health	my cat has had diarrhea for months  the vet put him on royal canin and that did not work  then she put him on hills i d its been 8 days and nothing  he has 2 cans left from the  58 a case i got  that is over  200 a month for cat food  where are the coupons     i love my cat and he is literally starving in front of me 
quality	cats will not eat new formula with larger kibble  they have barely eaten in three days  anyone know if i can find the old formula anywhere  i have fed i would to my cats for years and ordinarily would give it a 5  vet should have warned me to save some old to mix with new to transition the cats gradually  but did not 
health	we switched because of vets recommendation and have not really seen any changes to warrant the higher price  we are in the process of slowly switching over to blue buffalo with no grains and sensitive stomach and everything seems fine 
health	the food is supposed to help reduce vomiting  unfortunately  my cat started throwing up much more frequently when we tried to switch to this food  when we stopped it  she went back to her weekly throw ups 
quality	this food stinks terribly  none of my cats would eat it  and they are not picky eaters  we bequeathed it to the dog  who eats anything 
quality	my 15 year old cat has started having problem with her teeth so i’ve been feeding her soft food besides her regular food  i’ve been trying different brands and had fed her a few samples of meow mix  i decided to order these  even though they were slightly different from the samples  but she wouldn’t touch them  she actually walked away from her dish as soon as i put it in there so i went back to the other kinds  not sure what the difference was as it was the same brand but she wasn’t having it 
quality	i am sure the food is good  but my animals would not touch it  in fact  i feed some homeless cats and they would not eat it either 
quality	the kibble is too small for an adult cat  especially a large adult cat to be able to get one bite on  it is the size of kitten food  they would have to pretty much eat it whole which is not good for their tummy  my cat does not mind the taste but will not eat it unless i mix it with something larger 
quality	i have tried this product before and decided to give it a second chance  same thing  my cats eat it and act like they did not eat or  this again  
quality	my cats were fed fancy feast for ten years and just out of the blue they stopped eating it  i think something in the formula has changed and i contacted the company and of course  they said  no   what i go by is what my cats are telling me by no longer eating the product  what i do love is chewy  com  i love chewy  com and will always be a customer  i have switched to the simply fancy feast food  they cats like it much better  chewy is amazing 
quality	all three cats did not like this food  i figured  it had gravy  how could i go wrong  they refuse to eat it and now i am stuck with a case of it 
quality	my cat would not eat it it  i donated it to the local cat shelter 
quality	cats would not eat it  going back to rachael ray chicken and brown rice dry cat food 
product	do not recommend  blue changed the formula  none of the cats will eat it now  asked blue and they did not answer if the formula was changed  3 bags later   i have my answer  none of the cats will eat anything out of the 3 bags  disappointed  we have used blue for 12 years
quality	i usually buy the grain free blue buffalo bought this bag on accident  none of my four cats would eat this stuff  tried feeding it to the stray ally cats and they also turned their noses up at it  wouldn’t recommend it 
health	cat does not like this food at all  i bought it because of the reviews and i did not want to give him the food he was eating before because the reviews i read from others were about making their animals sick  so now i have a huge back of cat food that he will not eat  i am better off going to petsmart or some other store where i can return it easily 
quality	i love my cat more than my family  that is my reason for purchasing blue buffalo dry cat food  my baby had been eating another very popular leading brand which contained cereal and byproducts  naturally i wanted the best for her  i introduced her to blue buffalo and took away the inferior brand  she approached her new food choice  took one sniff out of curiosity  and walked away  normally she munches on her dry food 24 7  she eats a can of wet food daily at supper time  with her new dietary fare  she would only eat her wet food and turned her tail on the blue buffalo  this went on for one full week until her daddy broke down and returned her to the inferior popular brand  the blue buffalo was
quality	i bought this for my new kitty  abbey   but she literally smelled it and walked away  i kept trying to convince to eat it and placed it in 3 areas in the house  but noticed the bowls were still full  i put it out for the strays  and they barely ate it  it might be a healthier choice  but my kitty gave it a thumbs down 
quality	my cats do not like it  they want they our previous brand 
quality	my cat is eating some of this which is a victory  she eats mixed with royal canin maine coon  tried blue wilderness and some other highly rated grain free and she just does not like it  only time will tell 
quality	we have four cats  i used to buy sheba cans because of the healthy no grain option of sheba  my cats loved it  any flavor  when sheba switched to plastic trays my cats refused to eat it  they simply sniffed it and walked away  i tried many times and in different ways to get them to eat it but they refused  not sure if the smell of the plastic gets in the food or what  i am sad sheba stopped making their food in cans 
quality	all 6 of my cats love sheba and i previously purchased the multipacks with cans  not trays  none of my cats will eat sheba in the trays  no matter what flavors  i gave the left over trays to my daughter for her cat and she will not eat them either  something must have changed so i can no longer purchase sheba as you do not offer it in the cans any longer 
product	my cats hate pate but if your cats love it  buy it chewy has the best so next time i will not buy pate 
product	chewy com you do excellent work  i absolutely love your efficiency and service  however  i was surprised to find all the packages of chicken in this box  i thought it would be evenly balanced with the same amount of all three flavors advertised 
health	i’m sure it’s a good food  but my cat is starting to throw up massive hairballs
health	with our first and oldest cat  we used to free feed her this iams  that is when we really noticed that she was getting fat  she is a very petite cat  and ideally at 8 9 lb cat  but with this  she quickly ballooned to 11 lbs  we decided we had to make a change and switched her to a grain free and she started losing weight very quickly  as far as supermarket brands go  iams is ok  there are far worse ones out there  so if you have no other option  it is ok  but i would definitely recommend controlling the portions  even when free feeding the grain free  she still lost weight because she did not have to eat as much  and it was not full of fillers  even though this iams is ok  it still has lots of fillers
product	the food is great but several of the cans were dented  some to the point of leaking juice onto other items in the bag  for the price  having to todd several cans was unacceptable 
product	it is great getting delivery of cat food and the bigger the box  the better  however  friskies needs to mix it up a little more  my cats like variety and there are too many cans of the same food  i only bought this box because it was cheaper than buying individual cans 
product	i liked the package but  unfortunately my cats did not  feeding to wildlife and will go back to feeding my cats fancy feast 
quality	my cat really does not like  shredded food i thought i had ordered pate didnt notice until i opened a few cans
product	my cat is not used to having too much fish  this is the first time i tried this variety pack for him  i try not to give him a lot of fish because i have read that it is not the healthiest option for cats  the sardines are huge chunks  i have to break it up before giving it to him  so it is not convenient  although he loves friskies canned food  this was not a great selection for him  i only give it to him occasionally and i have to mix it with his other food to get him to eat it  so it does not go to waste  i would not buy this variety pack again 
product	the product was great  and the price was amazing  my only issue was most of the cans had severe dents in them  some i had to use a can opener to open because the top was so dented 
quality	i have bought this brand and flavor of food for years for my cats without ever having an issue  my cats will not eat the food from the bag i received from chewy com   not sure if it is stale or bad or what  i purchased another bag from my local grocery to be sure they were not just ready for a flavor change and they ate it no problem 
product	please do not buy your cat this food  its absolute garbage  0
quality	my cats do not like this product  maybe other cats will 
quality	cats seem to enjoy it   i wasnt sure in the beginning  the  problem is i do not like these small cans   and neither do my 3 cats   more for single cat use not multi cats
quality	my cats are like garbage trucks  they will eat anything  i look for food that is grain free  and has meat as it is first ingredient  the biggest problem i had with this product is that the cans were impossible to open  i had to throw away a half case because i could not get it open  the metal tabs would break off and it would not fit under the can opener 
quality	i decided to try this out on a bogo offer  it is hit or miss on any given day if my cats will eat it  i have had to keep some fancy feast and blue on hand to make sure they eat if they turn their nose up at it  if i have to have backup food it is not worth it  i will not purchase again  but your mileage may vary 
health	my 17 year old cat has digestive issues so i tried this based on its ingredients  he likes variety and i would hoped it would replace fancy feast  but alas he does not especially like it  he tends to lick the gravy and leave bits behind  the bits stayed soft which i liked  but once the gravy was gone he would not touch it  i will donate the rest to someone in need 
quality	my cats will not eat this food  it looks good but my finicky cats say  no  to the taste 
quality	i really wanted to enjoy this and switch my cat from a brand that uses too much plastic  no matter what i did  my cat would not eat this  ended up donating it  ingredients were good and i always love a variety pack  but as others have mentioned  there is a distinct lack of gravy fot a gravy formula  will be sticking with her current food for now 
quality	my mom bought me a whole case of this food and i do not like it so i told her do not buy me anymore 
quality	i have never thought of my cat as picky  but i guess i had just been lucky in the past  not only would he not eat it  but he would not even go close to it 
quality	cat hates it   will not eat it     turn his nose up and walks away    cat hates it  
quality	i do not understand but my cats will not eat this nor will the stray i feed twice a day 
quality	i gave the american journey food to my neighbor  my cat turned his nose up at it 
product	i have a picky cat who usually will at least eat some of any minced chicken food with gravy  but she would barely even taste these flavors  and the poultry fish variety pack   i purchased them on sale so it was not as expensive of a loss as some others we have tried  but it is disappointing  the food appears to be of a good quality and does not have any strong odors so i am not sure what the problem was  as long as your cat is not as picky as mine  they will probably eat this 
health	my bengal baby has been dealing with allergies to many different foods and brands  she can handle the turkey in this batch but the chicken base does not work well for her  
quality	not sure what to say  my guys do not like it but there is nothing wrong with it  may work well for your cat  it is what it says   minced poultry in gravy  if you think your cat likes finely chopped poultry in gravy then this might be for you  my guys seem to prefer the pate from this brand 
health	i bought this food to add into my cats wet food rotation  of the three  one would eat this  and he will eat anything so that isn’t saying much that he would eat this  the ingredients seem pretty good which is why i bought it  however  it smells like human vomit  i could not stand the smell of this  my one cat who would eat it did just fine on this food and had no issues  but the smell is just terrible and the other two would not touch it  overall  i personally would not order it again even at the discounted price 
quality	kitty will eat a few bites and then will not eat any more  wasting most of the can  i love the bite size  there is not as much gravy as i expected  sorry to say i will not buy again  i have a full case less three cans of both the poultry and the poultry seafood 
product	i have two house cats and two in the barn  i really wanted american journey to become my auto delivery food of choice as it sounded like a safe  quality product at a good price  i do not feed my cats fish too often as i worry about mercury  plus it makes their breath and the litter boxes smelly  none of the four cats like beef flavor food  i  therefore  chose to introduce them to the poultry in gravy variety pack  the minced poultry and thick gravy looked and smelled ‘clean’  ie  no off odor or weird oily cast   however  neither one of my decorative house cats would touch the chicken or chicken   turkey combo flavors  they did eat some of the plain turkey flavor  but still left a lot in
health	purchased a case of this along with the american journey dry cat food  and unfortunately both gave all 8 of my cats severe diarrhea  they ate the food ok  although they did not run to it like their previous food  which is from a different brand  but within a few days all of them got the runs  i could not figure out whether it was from the dry food or the canned food so i tried only giving them one or the other for a few days at a time  and both gave them the runs   so it is both of them  the price point is good on this  but there are other brands in this same price point that i have tried previously that contain similar or better ingredients that do not give my cats the runs so i will be going back
quality	i have a cat that eats everything except tiny tiger cat food  i really do not blame him though because it smells and looks horrible  we will definitely not be buying again and i now have a case of unusable food 
quality	buy 1 get 1 free    so i bought it  i chose extra gravy as my lil cat loves gravy    she sniffed it and walked away  i tried 3 different times and she would not eat this   and she is hungry eats several times a day    
quality	3 cats and not one would eat this food gave to another cat owner and it also would not eat this food  it just stayed in the dish 
quality	it looks good extra gravy  my cats will not touch it  they both sniffed it and walked away  it sat there all day  tried all 3 flavors with the same results  gave to my neighbor to try with her cat 
product	yea  no  the cats refused to touch it  would not even eat the gravy  i tried each flavor  this is a fail for my kitties  also they came to me dented during shipping  i have given them to my niece for her cats  we will have to see if this is an unique reaction  but my two cats were noping this 
health	i have one sick cat and two who eat anything and none of them would touch it   
quality	my cats did not like this food  sorry not sure why  i was hoping that they would but they refused to eat this   i will donate what is left 
quality	my cats would not eat tiny tiger and sorry i purchased both kinds 
quality	spot does not like tiny tiger he smells it and walks away  spot does not even lick the gravy  i might keep trying but i feel it is a lost cause  spot loves friskies with gravy  so there must be a difference  thank you
quality	my two cats love the gravy  but they do not eat much of the meat  also  it smells pretty good when you first open it  but after a while the dish and empty cans reek of dead something  lol 
health	my cat  whose really not too picky of an eater  but who does love gravy  chose to lick all of the gravy and leave behind most of the chunks  substance in the can  especially with the beef  i got it on sale at s really good price  so no harm done  but i will not be purchasing again 
quality	some flavors they are not eating it as good as others
product	i bought this product based on a recommendation from my pet store  the packaging is great  and although my 3 furry friends do eat it  the varieties all look and smell the same no real differences between flavors
quality	i have a cat that eats this just fine  but the other prefers the junky stuff  friskies  sheba  and it is a struggle to get him to eat it  which is bad b c all his supplements for arthritis go into his wet food  i can tell the food itself is very good quality  but unfortunately i will not be buying again b c the older boy does not care for it 
quality	watery  i do not like the smell and neither does mz  fiji
quality	pay the extra   get fancy feast if this was   extra  gravy  hate to see regular gravy  also  it is stinky 
quality	my cat is a spoiled queen and he would rather starve than touch the beef flavor  but he did mildly enjoy the poultry flavors  i won’t be buying this again since he won’t eat a third of it  i try and try to get him to eat healthier canned food  but he prefers the low quality pouches  i’ll be switching out my auto ship for something different 
quality	our three cats all really liked these cans at first but when i ordered a second box they snubbed their noses at it  i tried giving some to my friend to see if her cats would eat it and they would not touch it either  i do not know why they seemed to like them at first then changed their mind  it is too bad  i thought i had finally found a reasonably priced grain free food for them 
quality	i am not sure how finicky my cat is  he is your average 1 yr old black house cat  he demands a can of wet cat food  with gravy type  with his dry food each day  i have typically use fancy feast but tride this one for the price value  he refuses to eat it  so not sure what that means about the product  but that was my experience 
product	my kitten loved the gravy  he was not really into the chunks though  he is a kitten and we are still figuring out what he likes 
product	disappointed in the drop in quality and the inclusion of meat by product  however the only thing my older cat will eat  overall not a bad food  cats love it though  great for picky eaters 
quality	i bought the seafood variety pack and my cats just love it  i bought the beef   poultry variety pack and nope  a total waste of money  they will not touch it  i am sure other cats might like it  mine are extremely picky so i will stick to the seafood recipes and sheba as an alternative for something different 
quality	i thought i would try this instead of fancyfeast gravy lovers     my cats refused to even eat it      with no other food around for 3 hours he still would not touch it     then i thought ok maybe my mom s cat s might eat this  nope       do not buy this  stick to fancy feast gravy lovers  i am probably going to throw away the other 22 cans  i am hoping i can find some place to donate them 
quality	my cat did not like it at all  she absolutely refused to eat it   
quality	i have a finicky 19 year old  and i thought he might like this food  since it costs twice as much as the friskies he usually gets  but he will not touch it  only the feral cats like it 
health	i have been feeding this to my comet  for years  who used to have urinary tract and weight problems  since then he is had no more blockages and his weight is under control  he used to love it and still does but i do not understand why they changed the recipe when they changed the label  it used to have nice soft chunks that i mashed up to make a paste but now the chunks are hard like little pieces of erasers  i cannot even squash them with a spoon  i gave it 3 stars because comet still eats it but a few months ago i would have given it 5 stars  i am thinking of asking his vet if i can switch to another brand because if the texture is different i am worried that maybe the ingredients have been changed
quality	had high hopes  but cats will not eat it  will keep trying
quality	i bought this on my vet s recommendation since my cat has food sensitivities  both of my kitties do not care for it  i end up throwing it out  waste of money 
health	extremely expensive  and it did not change a thing as far as his skin condition or his itching  hairballs  nothing has changed  i will buy the instinct rabbit formula next time  no prescription needed and still just 1 protein  and save some money because it does not say prescription on the can 
product	i am a long term chewy customer and i do auto shipping  my vet recommended this rabbit formula for my senior cats  after  50 plus dollars thinking my cats would benefit from this expensive cat food  opened the can none of my cats would even take one bite      they simply sniff at it and walk away           i have tried again and again for over a week now  still none of my cats would eat this supposedly good expensive formula  i am very disappointed that this was a waste of money     
quality	i am sure it is very high quality  but all three of my cats refused to eat it  i have a cat with severe ibd so i was told to try this food  but he would just pick at it  my other two healthy cats went on hunger strikes and refused to eat it too  i tried all three flavors   duck  venison  and rabbit   and no luck  i had to return it 
quality	my cats really like the pate portion of this but will not eat the chicken chunks  have to pick them out before they will eat  the pate in this seems to be more flavorful  moist vs the f f  chicken feast pate i usually buy for them 
product	i purchased 2 cases of chunky feast food not knowing the ingredients listed  my cats love it  but i will not buy it anymore for the reasons it contains wheat gluten  soy flour  soy protein and carrageenan  these ingredients are not healthy especially for my pre diabetic cat  most of the fancy feast classics seem to have better ingredients  but the chunky  grilled or gravy have not 
quality	the cats do like most of the fancy feast flavors  but this is not on that list  mine really do not like the pate texture and that is what this is  despite it saying  chunky 
quality	my fur friends do not like the new formula  therefore  neither do i  the lower price does not make up for the change in value 
health	bought this in desperation to find something the cats will eat after going on hunger strike  unfortunately they will not touch it  i do not think it is the fault of the food  but rather something weird going on with the cat colony  i have bought 9 different cat foods  and they have only shown interest in one  with 7 cats   i m in danger of going broke buying everything in sight trying to find a food the little beasts will approve of     yikes 
quality	my two siamese cats said no on this one  they ate it the first day and then after that they would not even look at it  wish it would have worked out 
health	i bought this for dimples who will often vomit after she eats  she likes the food  as do the other cats  but she still vomits sometimes after she eats  hill s makes a good product  so i recommend it without question 
health	they changed their formula  the old formula  egg and rice  significantly changed my cats stomach and skin issues for the better  i noticed the issues returned  and could not figure out why   and then i realized  the formula changed to this chicken recipe  not sure what is in this new formula  in comparison to the old   but it is not doing what it used to  i have struggled to find something that will suit my cats like the old formula did  currently trying blue sensitive stomach  but no positive changes as of yet  please consider that the reason this product has such a good review average is that many of the reviews are for the old formula 
quality	not sure why the formula as changed  but now my cat will not eat  he does not like the new formula at all 
health	i bought this dry food for our 16 year cat with a sensitive stomach  he sniffs it and then walks away and will not touch it  our other cats do not seem to mind it so that is the reason for the 3 stars  we did buy the science diet canned sensitive stomach  chicken  and the old guy loves it 
health	have been using hill s science diet adult sensitive stomach and skin dry cat food for about a month  the cat that we got it for prefers to eat our other cat s hills k d  kidney health formula  and the cat that should be eating the hills k d prefers the sensitive stomach and skin formula  i just purchased another bag of the sensitive stomach   skin dry cat food so i may have more to share when that bag is finished  other than that  i do not have any other observations that i can share 
health	my cat with stage 3 kidney disease will not eat this food  i can get her to eat some delectables stew   some fancy feast liver   chicken with epakitin on it  she used to eat the dry renal a  but she has not been eating dry food for awhile  i am sure this is a quality product  though 
quality	i have been forced to put my sweet and priorly healthy cat on a science diet  i am not even remotely thrilled about the ingredients in the selections  but i tried to choose the best of the worst ingredients  but she will not eat this 
quality	i bought several cans at the vet and the product was nice consistency and smelled fresh and my cats liked it  so i ordered a case from chewy  it was totally different  thick  pasty smelly and had particles gunked around the top that at first i thought were maggots  i don’t know what it was  my cats smelled it and walked away  i’m not sure if it was old  bad or some other weird formula  chewy what’s going on this is the second case of royal canin product i ordered that is bad and unusable 
quality	hey  my cat jack loves the renal t and renal d cans of food however he refuses to eat this gelled food  renal e  the smaller 3 ounce cans of food have shreds of meat and is really juicy  he licks up all the juice and returns in a while to eat the shreds  he leaves the gel for days and eats nothing  sadness i bought a case of it 
quality	unfortunately  my senior cat will not eat it  he is very finicky 
quality	both my cats require renal diets  despite a gradual introduction to this food  they still refuse to eat it  i purchased two cases so i will keep trying      
quality	my cat did not like this food  she is a picky eater and sniffed it tried to eat it but it was so dry she gagged on it  i added a little water to it and she ate a little bit more but she ended up leaving most of it  she has not eaten any of it since  again  she is a picky eater but i thought it looked dry too 
quality	my cat does not like the other renal diet canned foods that i have tried over the past four months  she does not find this one too objectionable and will eat it 
quality	bought a couple of cans from the vet and my cat loved it so i bought a case from chewy and he will not touch it     waste of     but i had no clue that he would not like it 
quality	cat would only eat this twice  after that she turned her nose up  it seems to have better ingredients than some of the other renal diet foods out there  good enough to keep trying 
product	i did not know it was pate  i did not see any information on the ad or package  the pets like it but i would not order it again 
quality	my two previous cats only ate science diet food  my new cats have eaten other higher end cat foods with no complaints  i decided to try it on my new kitties  and they will not eat it  i do not get it  now i am stuck with a huge bag 
product	my cats liked this food well enough but the packaging is an absolute disaster  totally impossible to pull the seal back without getting substantial amounts of cat food all over your hands  both skeevy and wasteful  would not recommend or buy again  can’t believe they haven’t fixed this it’s really bad 
quality	reading all the great reviews about picky cats eating this good i thought there was hope  unfortunately  my picky cat smelled all three flavors and would not touch any of them  my other cat who eats everything would not eat it either  ugh 
quality	if your cats like the cuts  then this product is great  unfortunately  my cats are very picky and want more gravy   they love the fancy feast gravy lovers  the cuts are a little bigger than in fancy feast and my cats would not eat it  guess i ztick with fancy feast next time 
quality	my cats will not eat this product as it is unappetizing to them  they lick the juice off and leave the cuts  they do however love the pate version  
health	i ordered this chicken variety pack  a seafood variety pack and 2   16 pound bags of dry seafood sensations to be sent to an elderly couple  the man had a stroke and was hospitalized so the woman was left to care for 3 cats and 3 kittens  she had no car and could not get to the store for food for the cats  the group of 6 went nuts over the seafood sensations dry and the canned seafood variety pack but would not eat any of the chicken variety pack  i retrieved the chicken variety from the woman and tried to feed it to a stray that comes to my house to eat and visit with my indoor cats through the door  he would not eat this either  i have to say i have fed this stray the seafood friskies and he
product	i guess i had the wrong conception  i thought that since i specified that i wanted turkey product then all i would have gotten from your end would have turkey products  if i wanted a variety i would have gone to the store to buy just that  with that being said i was really disappointed with my order  that is why i have not reordered
health	this canned food made my cats vomit every time i fed it to them  i will not ever buy friskies ever again 
quality	my main problem is my cats will not eat two varieties in this pack 
quality	accidently ordered this instead of gravy lovers cat food  cats do not like it   but they will eat it when they get good and hungry  spoiled brats  
quality	i am undecided on this product  i bought it because i want to give my kitten a good healthy start but when i opened the bag  the smell of it is so terribly overwhelming and i noticed my kitten is not eating as much of his dry food since i switched to this brand  i am going to go through the bag and try it until it is gone  but i do not think i will be reordering 
quality	the dry food and treats were meally  the cans were dented and the litter containers were damaged  all products were packed in a single box that was too heavy to be lifted  i like the prices but the savings is lost in poor quality 
quality	one sniff    and walked away never to return for several hours    just discarded it 
quality	even the stray feral cats in the neighborhood would not eat the 9 lives  holding out for the friskies  fortunately  the possums were not as picky  so it eventually got eaten 
product	not even the stray cats in my neighborhood would eat it  i bought it because it was inexpensive and thought the well known name would mean cats probably like it but i was wrong  don’t waste your time 
quality	i bought this for the feral colony and normally they love when i put canned food out but they do not like this  and it does have a really unpleasant odor to it  they will eventually eat it  but i definitely will not get this for them again  unfortunately i still have an unopened box  
quality	my cats were not crazy over this food  i have 6 and they all walked away 
quality	i feed two cats that live outside my house and adopted me and my husband  i usually feed them friskies but thought i would try something different  they do not like it     luckily i purchased a lot of friskies too 
quality	two of two cats which i have tried this food with both approached the food in a similar fashion  they enjoyed the scent and flavor very much and licked the gravy from the food chunks  both cats were seniors  and that may be part of the reason why they did not eat the chunks of meat product  one would eat the chunks once they were smashed down with a fork 
product	my 4 cats did not like this food  they left it more often than they ate it  i will not buy it again 
quality	my cat would not touch it  had to give to shelter  a waste of money 
quality	i contacted chewy customer service before ordering this food and was told it is the size of a green pea  well to my surprise when i opened one of the bags it is much smaller than a green pea  my cat will not eat this food 
quality	i feel bad saying this  this was a gift from someone concerned about cat health  however  none of my 6 indoor cats would eat it  i tried mixing it with the brand they love  nope  they knew it was there and will not touch any of it  not even their fave  so  i decided to give it to the ferals i feed  even they refused  i feel bad that they didn t  but  to have about a dozen cats refuse it  i thought i should speak up  sorry 
quality	i took advantage of a bogo sale since i wanted to switch my animals to grain free food  my cats really like the food but  big but it smells so bad  pretty much stinks up my entire kitchen which is off the laundry which is where the food is  probably will not be purchasing again 
health	have been looking into the more organic foods for my senior cat that has lost a lot of weight in a few months time  he has a very sensitive stomach  but unfortunately this particular brand he only ate if it was mixed with sweet potato or mashed peas and fresh chicken  alone he will not touch it 
quality	like other reviewers  i ordered this food because of the bogo deal  normally i rotate bags of taste of the wild  a tsc brand  and diamond  a vet recommended i feed my slightly overweight cat a higher protein food  i tried a small bag of an expensive  high protein dry food with the first 4 or 5 listed ingredients being meat  but my indoor cat refused to eat it  the outdoor cat ate it without issue  from that experience  i should have known my indoor cat would not like american journey either  i left the food sit in his bowl for two days  every morning  his meows got louder  i finally gave up and purchased a bag of his usual food  since i have this large bag and a large bag of the duck  which i
health	my cats were absolutely sick eating this food  to the point that they refused to eat for a few days  american journey wet food is awesome  but the dry is a bad time  maybe it is just them  idk  i just know i cannot feed this to them 
quality	it may be a little soon to rate this catfood  my cat  toby  is not very fond of it right now  i am easing him into it but he is walking away a lot  time will tell  thus i only gave it 3 stars 
product	my cats  4  are very strange  they do not really like it in their bowls  but it ok as treats
quality	still searching for an evo replacement tried this  has high protein percentage  though my bengal does not like it  only gave it three stars   due to that fact  i am sure it is a very good product no big surprise that he does not like it  the search continues for something like evo 
quality	my cats do not like this  going to hunt for another dry grain free food healthy choice 
product	love the food but the bag arrived ripped open  there was very little effort put into the packaging of the products 
health	so my cat becky has always suffered from skin allergies  her vet proscribed food made out of rabbit and suggested the royal canin  becky loved it  and i saw a change in her skin allergies   she no longer obsessively liked her belly and her fur began to grow back after only a few weeks  unfortunately  after feeding her this food   and only this food   for about 6 months  becky was diagnosed as extremely diabetic  an issue she was did not have before going on this food  yes  it helps with allergies  but please be aware of your cats health and the dangers of feeding them dry food 
health	our vet prescribed wet and dry rc protein select  rabbit based  for our cat for a food allergy  our cat immediately loved both styles and the food alleviated her symptoms  excess grooming   scratching  vomiting   we were initially getting them directly from our vet but decided to order from chewy  the wet is consistently high quality and well received  but the kibble is a different story  the kibble we got from the vet was a light brown color and our cat chewed it easily  by contrast  the bag we purchased from chewy is dark brown in color and so hard that our cat labored to chew it   even a 20 minute soak in water barely softened it  can’t speak to flavor  but our cat now sniffs it and
quality	my older cat hates it  it is smells aweful  it must taste terrible  my other cat that is younger eats everything and anything but she would not go near the stuff either  i am so disappointed  it comes in such large quantities      i am stuck and do not know what to do with it now 
quality	been buying nutish for years  but cats do not like it anymore  i am switching to another brand 
product	i was told about this site from our vet s office  the fact that i have a large fur baby family it is sometimes hard for me to get to the store for things they need  i was able to place the order and in not time it was all shipped to our front door      food for them was packaged very well  i would recommend this site and company to all my family and friends 
quality	wanted to try this for my cats  they do not like it  i thought it would have the little veggie bits in it like the dog food  but it does not 
quality	my cat would not touch it  so i decided to feed it to the homeless cats and none of the homeless cats that i feed and give water to would eat it  so it sat in the bag  for that price  it should have been delicious and better than the friskies i always give the cats  this overpriced cat food seems to reflect rachel s name and not the quality and taste of the food  i am not going to buy anything she sells  not worth the money at all 
quality	smelly   smelly must have been old food the tops were sunken in when you open a plastic tub it smelled real bad my cats would not go near it they were trying to bury it
quality	i have got to have the worlds most finicky cat  he seems to really like a certain kind and the next he turns his nose up at it  i am at my wits end never knowing what to purchase or open for him next  right now i have a huge variety   selection of his  likes   the seafood pack above he does not care for but he does like the turkey   chicken one    on some days that is 
quality	i wish i had not order this  i have two cats  they both will not eat it  they do not even like the smell  i thought i would try something new because they get bored with their food  wrong choice  i even sat it outside for the stray cats  they did not eat it either  will not buy again 
quality	there is other stuff in these  looks like veggies  so my cats will not touch it  only bury it 
quality	my cats do not like it  fast delivery though  probably the fastest
health	my oldest cat had a bladder blockage at the age of 1  at that time  i started feeding him prescription c d  when i got another cat  i was feeding them both the same food  however  when i got 2 more cats  it became too expensive to feed all 4 of them the prescription diet so i began mixing it with the adult urinary hairball control  so far  the oldest has never had another urinary problem and neither have any of the others  one is 10 years old and the other 2 are 3 years old   i have only 2 complaints about the urinary hairball control   the pieces are too big  my cats have a difficult time eating them and i am not sure the hairball control really works all that well  2 of my cats still throw up
quality	my cat will not eat this food because the food morsels are so large  of course i bought the biggest bag    
quality	too big of pieces for cats to eat  they would not eat it  wasted money 
health	recently switched my cat to this formula who suffers from urinary issues  he had crystals 2 years ago and was put on the prescription food  two months ago  i made the switch to this considering it is more affordable  i noticed his stool became completely dried out  hard  chalk like  and very light in color  i was worried this may be a sign of lack of hydration because this food seems very grain based  coincidentally  last week he starting straining again and having bloody urine  we have been in and out of the vet for the past week trying to find a solution  the vet agrees that this might be the cause for his inflammation  unfortunately  i will be going back onto the prescription food because i
quality	not sure why but my girls just did not like this food  i had to go get them other food but now i know not to buy this  it is not your fault  chewy  i just know i tried it and they will not eat it  i did donate the case to my neighbor that has cats  we love chewy still 
quality	my cats aren’t really satisfied with this flavor about after the 3rd can  they were finished   refuse to eat the flavor  
product	my cats will only eat canned pate wet food  no shreds  i add a little water to make it like thick cake batter so they get more water and they like it this way  friskies is hardly the most expensive wet food  but it fits the bill for my purposes 
product	this whole case of cat food the cans are so crushed i am afraid to use them 
quality	i has 6 indoor cats  some semi feral  and feed 2 3 outdoor feral cats  i try and give wet food  especially in summer here in az  this food is inexpensive and they seem to love it  i have tried cheaper  store brand  foods and even the ferals will not eat it  price is same as in stores  so that is a bit disappointing when i am buying a whole case  but convenient since i am ordering more items anyways 
quality	there are three flavors in this variety pack and my cat turns his nose up to all of them  buying this case was a waste of money 
health	unfortunately my cats are older  the long shreds and not enough gravy has them throwing up  so this food will not be ordered anymore 
quality	both cats turned up their noses and would not eat it  will not buy again 
product	waste of money definitely over priced  i think this product is way overrated 
quality	not sure if my review went through  this brand may be okay  but my cat refuses to eat it  try every other day or week  but she will not touch it  cannot explain why  so i cannot recommend this brand
quality	hazel normally runs to her wet food  it was watery and she turned her nose up at it and kept looking at me to change it 
quality	didn’t see anything wrong with the food itself but our cats would not touch it
quality	cannot give better than one star when all three of my girls turned their noses up at this combo back  i ended up donating what i had left to a local shelter 
product	sorry my cats did not like this food maybe its just them  plus it was expensive
health	yuck  foreign seafood is and all it is chemicals is not safe for human consumption never mind an animal who is body mass is about 1 10 of our size 
quality	i had a lot of hope for this product  it smells good and looks fresh but my cat ate a little of each one and walked away  he is pretty particular  yours may love it  mine did not  precious money wasted should have just gotten 3 from the store to see if he would eat it 
quality	my boy rocky is not a picky eater  tends to eat anything you put in front of him  but he does not care for this food  perhaps it is the chicken variety  the others he eats willingly  i would not buy it again 
product	unfortunately  my cats barely touched this food  just the smell made them back away from their dishes  definitely not worth the price  it is hard to find a  healthy  choice that cats will eat 
quality	neither of my cats would eat this food  both sniffed and walked away 
quality	my cat would not touch it  but  then again  she is no gourmet  either 
product	as i said in the summery  it looks good but my cats did not like it  it is also usually a pretty expensive food but this particular packaging was priced well
quality	my 2 cats did not seem to like this wet food  as a matter of fact  they just took one sniff and walked away  guess i will not be ordering this again 
quality	my 7mo cat will not touch any of the flavors  i love that it comes in plastic cup packaging  i wish she would eat it but she takes one quick sniff and walks away  she is picky
quality	the food looks really good  like real  fresh fish  but unfortunately  my cat did not like it  he would only lick the gravy and not eat the chunks  to be fair  he is being fussy lately with his food so it might just be him  i still gave it a 3 star rating because the quality looks good and it might just be my cat being fussy 
product	not sure it the food was fresh  the bag was open and the food was out in the box
product	this flavor is not to my cats liking    he does not care that is good for him    nor does he care that it’s expensive finding things he will eat   
quality	my cat was recently diagnosed with feline idiopathic cystitis  and needs to be on prescription food for the rest of his life  i was not too worried  because he has eaten everything i have ever tried to give him   until this food  he refused to eat it  and when i mixed it with his regular food  he would go through piece by piece and spit out the prescription food pieces  i am giving 3 stars because i know another kitty who eats this food  and her humans are very happy with what it has done for her urinary issues  also  chewy s customer service is amazing  and when i contacted them about returning the food  they gave me a refund  and encouraged me to donate the food  i will continue to order from chewy
product	i ordered this one as an alternative to hill s c d urinary care chicken flavor due to less wheat in the fish flavor  it mainly has rice to replace wheat filler  the c d fish flavor kibbles are denser   harder and less fatty smelly aroma the cats like compared to its chicken flavor counterpart  i wish my boy cats do not have to use prescription diet or willingly eating wet food  without eating dry food first   i also have plenty of good dried food like orijen and wysong  but messing around with food for bladder crystal prone boy cats are costly and stressful 
product	my two kitties used to gobble this up  but now they try to bury it  i have noticed it does not smell the same either  very disappointing 
quality	please royal canin  bring back the old formula  i have both the new and old formula and my cat luna will not touch the new  when i break out the can of old formula she gobbles it up  and that supply is almost gone   side by side  the new formula is lighter  has a stronger smell and less meat  why royal canin   
product	you would think a premium product would pay more attention to their packaging  the product label is mis aligned  scuffed  and not well put together which makes it hard to read and use  this is not the first time i have had this issue with this product 
health	my cat loves this food  but i am still searching for a hairball formula that he loves and does not make him vomit  i am going to give it another month and see how it goes 
health	purina one hairball adult formula dry cat food may be a very good product  but in our case  we have just started our trial 
quality	my cats will not eat this food  they went 3 days without eating  so i changed food for them 
quality	i normally feed my kity the purina one hardball formula that has chicken listed as the  1 ingredient  i do not know why he does not like this flavor 
quality	this fancy feast smells so bad my 2 cats sniff it and walk away  it stinks and it is stiff and dry  the skunk outside has been eating pretty good lately
quality	2 out of my 3 cats did not care for it but the 20 yo went for it  has a strong odor 
quality	this may be good for others but i have 3 fish eaters that will not touch this stuff  as soon as you open the can it smells of rotten fish guts that smell up the entire house  it is so rancid my girls will not eat other food if it is near by and they try to cover it up  they are good with the turkey and chicken but i do not recommend this flavor 
quality	my 3 cats always eat fancy feast  are not interested in this one 
quality	i love most fancy feast products and use lots of them  but this one is too watery and the cats do not eat it  sorry  but i am trying to be truthful 
quality	and does not eat it  but i understand the need the backup to dry kd food is helping
quality	unfortunately my cat was put on this food by our vet for her poor kidney function and she hates it  she has lost 2 more lbs since starting it and she is already a tiny  skinny kitty  she is down to 6lbs now  my daughter in vet school says this food is not very palatable and most cats do not like it  since it is necessary for some cats i wish they would make it in a fish flavor and make it taste better  very disappointing  most hill s products are excellent 
quality	my kitty is 13  so i have got her on an expensive prescription diet  she loves the wet version of this  of course    but the dry option is more affordable  the problem is that she is not eating much at all  since she already needs to gain weight    i cannot afford to just throw the bag away  i am mixing half wet with half dry until i am out of the bag   hoping she eats it  buyer beware  there is a difference between wet   dry 
quality	it took a while for my cat to start eating this  she went hungry for a while  even with the wet food  she does not like carrots and eats around them 
quality	while i am sure it is quality product  my cat just will not eat it  he loves the wet food  but will pick around this dry food  it is worth a try but i would try to get a sample from your vet before committing 
health	she love the tasted but this gave my cat diarrhea  even though it was introduced gradually  right now we are sticking with the wet kd science diet ocean fish  which she also likes  i realize reactions will differ between cats  i do like hills science diet and my cats have always eaten their products 
health	my cat was diagnosed with the beginning stages of kidney disease and was recommended she start a kidney friendly diet  i started her on the hills k d dry and wet  the wet she would not touch  but the dry as time goes on  she eats on and off  i cannot say she loves it  but she does not hate it either  occasionally she stops by her bowl and crunches away  sometimes adding a little water helps or adding a little bit of food she does like  the food is guaranteed so it is always worth a try if your cat needs it 
quality	one would like to think a company dedicated to being the best food for our pets had the ability to create a food that our pets would eat  our beautiful jack is in the early stage of renal failure but he refuses to eat the k d  please hills   give us a helping hand so we can keep our beautiful cat babies with us as long as possible 
quality	i have 3 kittens  all 1 year old or less  and 2 adult cats  they absolutely do not like this food  so  i decided to feed it to the stray kitties  they do not like it either  eventually they eat it  but when i present it to them  they smell it  look at me in disappointment  and go on about their business  the food vanishes overnight  i am disappointed  i wanted the best for my furr babies  guess i have to go back to pro plan 
product	my pregnant mom a another mom had the shakes or were shivering on the iams kitten dry food  especially during delivery of her first litter of kittens  checked with vet who was also using this iams food  the center researched the problem and determined the hypocalcemia was due to this food  we then changed to royal canin which resolved the ptt
quality	i wanted to be fair before i wrote a review  my cat will eat the regular fancy feast sometimes  this sounded good all natural  i tried each variety in the pack  i do not know what is in this food  but my cat would not go near it  much less eat it  the cat would look at the dish and walk away  refused to eat it every time  will not buy this again 
quality	my kitties would not eat this  one sniff and they walked away 
quality	do not know why but they smell those and refuse to eat them 
quality	i received a free sample of this fancy feast gourmet cat food for my cats to try  i have 2 savannah cats a little over a year old  when i opened it they both came running  i always put their food on separate dishes  the both of them licked the broth off and did not eat any of the meat part  i am sure it is a great product just my cats did not like it 
quality	for some reason both of my cats will not eat this food  it is suppose to be more natural but for some reason they turn their nose and walk away  they will eat the original fancy feast pate but not this one  i was hoping they liked it due to the natural ingredients but no such luck 
quality	my cats really like the salmon and the duck flavors but they do not like the chicken  they will not even take a bite  i tried to mix in some dry food to get them to eat it but they are not having any part of it  i will have to see if there is a variety pack w o the chicken 
quality	all the cats did not like these cans of cat food  at times they did not even try it  just smelled it and walked away  so    i will be going back the fist canned cat food i was buying  so if you have finicky cat babies do not buy this kind    
quality	my little girl will not eat this  tried on all 3 and she said no will probably have to stick to tinytiger
product	surprised to say  my cats don’t like this food  chewey ordering and delivery is great 
product	my cat s used to love this  gobbled everything right up  last few packages i have opened  they hardly eat it  i end up throwing a lot of it away  obviously i am not the one eating  so it is hard to know what is different  when i open the cans they do not look different other than the pate seems more firm than previous batches  i have heard from my local pet store that blue buffalo has been acquired by general mills  not sure if there has been a change in the formulations  but all i know is my cats are not feeling this food anymore  the price has gone up and there is no use in me continuing to reorder if they are not really going to eat it 
quality	my cats did not like the recent food i got them  especially the duck  they would not eat it 
quality	dog will not eat it do not know why seems to be a good dog food but will not eat any variety  was on dry food before 
quality	i do not understand it  but my cat would not eat any of this  i even tried mixing it with another brand and she would not touch it 
quality	another fail for my picky cats sadly  both of my cats would not touch this soft food  i fed it to the neighborhood outdoor kitty instead so it got some good use  she seemed to like it    but then again outdoor cats eat anything  the hunt for a canned food my cats will enjoy continues   i have a black shorthair and a persian  seems like a great item and the brand is a good brand  just my cats are not enjoying it sadly    
quality	they will not eat any of these  they take a smell and immediately step away 
quality	my cat is not fond of pates  so she only eats half the can 
quality	i got these as a special treat for the cats   just something to mix things up  they eat them if they get hungry enough  however when i first put them out  the cats sniffed them and walked away  they love the other blue buffalo food  wet and dry    this one may just depend on the cat 
quality	bought this brand to try since the finicky kids loved the bb treats i got them  hated it  they walked up to their dishes  turned their heads and looked at me as if to say   mom  we do not eat this stuff   and walked away 
quality	looking to try something new for the finicky cats   unfortunately  this was not a winner  nice packaging  but the cats would not eat it 
quality	a friend ordered this along with my order  her cat is not eating it  she is not sure why  she and i agree that it is very nutritious food and good for the kitties 
quality	i was hoping my cat would like this product  but she will not eat it  i gave the cans away to friends with felines  hopefully they were able to use them 
product	i had my 5m bengal kitten on the blue kitten with salmon and chicken pack  it was pate  and she loved it  however seemed to get bored with it after while  so i saw this and i purchased it  and she did not like it  the salmon was a weird tannish color unlike the one from the kitten pack  the duck she did not like at all and that can be a preference  the chicken was not pate but more soupy  i was very disappointed  i had to throw more away then used  i do not recommend this pack on the overall appearance of the food  i put her on blue freedom wet food and she is all ready on the freedom kibble  loves it  because i have bought single wilderness previously and it was ok not great bt ok  the food was
quality	although she does like the blue buffalo dry food  she will not eat the wet  she normally eats the fancy feast pate  so we will stick with that 
health	i ordered this variety pack because the i love you variety pack that i usually get was out of stock  thought this was the next best option  my elderly cat  who has a sensitive stomach  loves all the flavors in the i love you pack  however  my cat refused to eat the duck flavor in this pack  she tolerated the chicken flavor  but i could tell she did not love it because she did not ever eat it all  salmon was definitely the favorite 
quality	my cat will only eat the salmon   she tried some of the chicken and the duck   ate a little and turned her nose up for the rest of it   i wound up throwing the opened cans away   i will give the rest of the cans to a neighbor whose cat is not so picky  
quality	my cats will not eat this food and the one threw it up 
quality	the food smelled really bad my cat s would not eat any of it
product	i used this food to mix with other more costly foods and decided saving money was not worth it  unfortunately  some of us cannot afford the more nutritious       canned food 
quality	my cats love friskies and will not go near this food  i bought it because of the price but have to go back to little cans 
quality	my cats love friskies as a rule  but would not eat this  perhaps it was a bad lot 
quality	ingredients look good  but cats will not eat it  do not know if it is just this flavor or what 
product	i have 8 dogs and 5 cats  i tried the american journey  got one free   thank you   just want to tell you that not one of my cats nor my rescue dogs  who eat anything  will touch it  i tried each one and they eat the salmon and chicken turkey ok  just wanted you to know  no need to refund or anything   one was free  just fyi
quality	i feed my 3 cats only american journey but they do not like the duck recipe at all  a waste of money  will not reorder
quality	they are not real thrilled about this  we tried it as a snack  thinking we could let them eat more  as they were not eating much dry food 
health	this bag of food had a lot of crumbs and kibble powder in it  more than any other bag of cat food i have ever bought  maybe i just got the end of the batch but i am hesitant to order this product again  the cats seemed to like it  no digestive or apparent allergy issues 
quality	my cats do not like this food  wish samples were sold so that someone could try before buying a large bag 
product	this food was not there most liked item i will not buy this flavor again 
quality	sorry  my cats do not like it  now i have a big bag and not use  better than a half price to startet  if that you get little example to try it
quality	i love chewy with their amazing customer service  i am sure other kitties would love this food but my picky eaters do not touch it  i still offer them but they are not eating  maybe i should just give up on trying 
quality	guess they do not like this  i gave it to a shelter 
quality	my multitude of cats and the wild raccoons will not eat it  such a disappointment since it is rather expensive to feed stray cats  i want healthy food for them  but i just wasted a lot of money that i cannot afford to waste
product	this food was not my cat s favorite  she just did not really want to eat it  she has been eating less of it as time went on  i am going to switch foods for her 
health	unfortunately  none of my cats would eat this food  i attempted a gradual change  and they literally picked out the other food  i was trying to find a non chicken based product  since the gsd steals from the cats  and he has a chicken allergy  i’ll continue my search  it would be great if samples could be made available  thanks as always chewy  for your great selection and great customer service 
product	i am sure there are cats out there who like this food  my 5 do not  but i do love chewy overall because of their great services  easy to order from and the delivery time is very short 
product	my five kitties will eat this but they are not real thrilled about it  it is grain free so that part is good 
product	this is my normal order and this time when my package arrived the bag felt lighter  and when i filled up my cat food tin i had hardly any left in the bag and i always have about half the bag left   the food it self it great no complai t s with the food   but   something feels funny   i spend so much money a month and get no rewards no free shipping despite your adds   and no coupons ever   and now this  
health	i have a bengal who seems to get digestive issues from grains and poultry  so i feed him grain free  fish based food  i used to get him an evo herring formula  which he loved  but no one sells it locally and that company quit selling through online retailers   so i tried this one  i did not really think there had be that big of a difference  but the bengal pretty much refused to eat it  even when he was really hungry  he just kept walking away  so i ended up mixing it with a blue wilderness food to feed to my other 2 cats just to use it up and not waste it  the other two were not happy at first  but have given in  i recently tried this one instead  
quality	i have 3 cats 2 ragdolls an 1 siamese they would not eat it   they walked away from it i tried for 4 days then i gave the food away 
quality	i would recommend this product to someone who is on a budget but wants a food better than those found in most stores that contain corn and other hamful ingredients  diamond has a good number of recalls so i avoid buying it too often 
quality	my animals do not believe your reviews  they do not like it 
quality	my 2 girls are not touching them probably because they have no smell to them
quality	yet another treat my murphy turned his nose up at  even molly wasn’t gaga over this one and she’s a chow hound 
quality	great idea but my older cat does not like them  which is who i thought would like them 
quality	my cats would not even touch these saw chip looking treats  they definitely do not look like  cat petizing 
health	one cat would not touch them  the other cat threw up right after eating one 
quality	both of my cats  snubbed thier nose at this treat  will not touch it
quality	seemed like a perfect treat option  but marlo will not even look at them  i gave them away to a friend 
product	i bought these because i rescued two kittens that were trapped in a pile of firewood  i used this when i started introducing wet food  i do need to add that its not entirely pate  so be careful  it is a mixed texture pack  i did not end up using the chucky texture until they were older  i also wanted to mention that this food is kinda pricey if you are feeding more than one kitten  nevertheless  they loved the flavor of this wet food 
quality	this made my kitten very gassy and she did not care for it very much  when she realized i was not feeding her anything else she walked back to it and ate it slowly  but for the next few hours she is passing gas and just plain stinks  other brands i have tried do not do this 
health	my main reason for getting this was because it’s supposed to have double the nutrients since kittens need much more than adults  they don’t have much more protein at all  i should have read the ingredients before purchasing but it is very processed and the fish ones have land animal meat products in them  if you don’t mind the food being processed and causing health issues down the line then this product is fine for you  the tuna one is like flakes instead of a solid patae 
health	this food does not agree with both my cats  gave them diarrhea  vet said the food needed more fiber
quality	my cats would not touch this food  i think it is the consistency they do not like  it is like soupy oatmeal  not a broth with chunks of meat as described in the heading  my cats love broth with meat chunks  the description is a bit inaccurate  ingredients  however  are good  i have to remember to stick with the tried and true and only buy what i know they like 
quality	the ingredients in this wet cat food is pretty decent but upon opening the can it was runny with no chunks  my cats ate it of course but was asking for more after a short time  plus it went right through my elderly  cats system which is very unlike her  i am going back to our tried and true  earthborn 
quality	my cats will eat this on occasion  but very seldom  i think it is the salmon maybe as they are not too fond of this fish  just about the only one they are not fond of 
quality	i had this food setup as an auto ship  the last shipment of 5 cases was sent on july 13th 2017 and i received it a few days later  opened the first can and it is totally a different texture  smell  and evidently taste because my cat said something that i am glad i did not fully understand and walked away  the next day she walked away again  i sent it all back for a refund 
quality	the product looks good to me but my 2 cats will not eat it  they only like fancy feast    
quality	jelly     strange looking consistency       very fishy sent     my cats walked away     
health	i have been mixing this with the cats  regular food in the hopes of decreasing hairballs  they seem to like it ok  i really cannot say that it has decreased hairballs at all  but maybe  probably will not be buying again just because it does not seem worth the trouble 
health	i have not tried it long  only two weeks  so i cannot really say if it has helped snickers   her hairball issues  she loves the taste though  very much 
quality	my cats do not like this  i have 16 cans left  do you take exchanges  i throw away more than they eat  thanks sandra
quality	this is my cat s favorite food and must be a favorite of other kitties as well because my local grocery store cannot keep this in stock  so when i was making out my food order for the kennel i manage  i checked to see if this cat food was carried  the can looks identical to the ones i purchase at my store  but the food itself has a much different texture and my cat refuses to eat it 
product	this food has a great taste and my cats love it  but  i have not noticed them acting any different  it claims to reduce anxiety in cats and i have not seen this yet  i did buy a 2nd bag because they do love it and i am hoping i will notice a difference in them if not will not buy again as it is pricy and price just went up 
quality	unfortunately the cats do not like the food  it is also too expensive since it goes it 3 weeks  3 cats  for a person on a fixed income  they like aims urinary  you do not sell this item  thank you
quality	one of our kitties has fluts that is idiopathic  so we have no idea what the cause is  our vet recommended that we try the stress version of the c d diet  which they all eat and digest just fine   we must not have mixed the bags well enough because they will not tough the stress version  which is stressing us out because they just run around meowing that they are hungry   i am so happy this has been a lifesaver for so many other customers but it is just different enough where our little freaks will not touch it 
health	first  i believe these prescription diets do what they are supposed to do  my sick kitty s condition is slowly improving with the use of this food  but there is a problem with the formula  i do not understand why all of these prescription diets contain corn and wheat  in this formulation corn and wheat are the 2nd  3rd  and 4th ingredients  one of my kitties currently has a urinary infection and the vet said that he needed this diet to help eliminate the crystals forming while he has the infection  we feed free choice  and the vet said that all of our kitties could eat this prescription food  so i served it to all of my kitties at first  we stopped serving dry cat food that contains corn and
product	dry and delivered with many cans crushed by co shipped kitty litter  delivery box was in bad shape on delivery  purchased for high protein but if your cat finds it so dry it is inedible it becomes garbage on delivery 
quality	so my cats aren’t picky  they don’t like blue buffalo wet food  but they like all other kinds and brands  except this tiki cat  they jumped back away from their bowls when i put it down in front of them  usually they go headfirst into a new bowl of wet food  i tried adding water as i thought maybe there wasn’t enough “gravy” for them  but they took a few licks and walked away  i’ll be donating this box and hopefully the shelter will have some kitties that have a more expansive palate 
product	based on the positive reviews of this item  i ordered a box for our cats  the box contains twelve cans with six flavors  neither of my cats liked the sardine cutlets  unfortunately  there were four cans of sardine cutlets rather than two as i expected  it must be the least costly variety  so they put twice as many of it in the box  i will not reorder this item 
quality	my cat will not eat it  and some of it is so disgusting looking  can o  chum would be a good name   that even if she did  i do not think i could bring myself to feed it to her 
quality	the cat will not eat the tuna  and there is 4 different tunas  not one bite   he thinks it is gross and it is  strong smell and looks yucky   he will the sardines  these i smash up a bit and add a little water to make it soupy 
quality	my cat despises each and every one of the flavor varieties  my cat will usually eat just about anything offered so this is a major letdown  even my dogs turn their nose up at these ones  will not be buying these ever again and will have to find a use for the several cases i just ordered 
health	my cat eats tiki cat tinned food daily  but most of the tins in this pack made her vomit  lots of fish bones    
quality	i guess i will give it a 3 only because my cats turned their noses up  but the church cats loved it  so a win for the homeless mews     
quality	my cat can be finicky  but he usually likes seafood flavors  so i thought i would give these a try  he has turned his nose up to all of them  i cannot say i can blame the food itself  it is likely more his discrimination taste  i should have known better than to buy a case  i will say  however  that the sardines cutlets variety is pretty strange  it has huge pieces of sardines in it  not something i would think most cats would eat just based on the size of the pieces 
health	gave my cat diarrhea for the first time in his entire life  i always thought he had a iron stomach but this food has proven me wrong  he did like the flavor though 
quality	my cat only ate the hawaiian grill   ahi tuna flavor  and he stuck his nose up at the rest  i thought the sardines would be a big hit  but he would not touch them  the chunks were big  and it did seem a bit too watery 
quality	it is chunky with almost like a tomato base  she just turned her nose up to it   now i have 11 cans just sitting around   
product	i was hoping with the more natural products in this food  actual anchovies    my cats would eat it up  but instead were bewildered and not enjoying it at all 
quality	i was incredibly disappointed in this purchase  my cats will only eat shredded food  and the description says the food contained in these cans are shredded  i am trying to switch my cats from friskies to a higher quality food  so i searched by  shredded  as a keyword  not only are these not shredded  there were giant chunks of sardines  my cats would not touch this food  so this was a total waste of money 
quality	my cats will not eat this  but they may just be picky    
product	most of the cans were a miss  and the ones my cat did like  she threw it up  it looks healthy and fresh  but it must be the texture  each flavor looked different and unappetizing to me  so   not buying these again 
quality	i have four cats  i have only tried this with the two older cats but they absolutely will not touch it  my 11 year old just stares at me when i put it down in front of her  if none of my cats like it i will try to feed it to the feral cats i have been taking care of 
quality	my cat licked at it and then would not eat anymore  i tried three different recipients out of the package and she just would not eat it 
quality	my kittens will just not eat these vthey like the chicken and the chicken salmon  but they will not even eat these at all
health	my kitty has food allergies that require him to be on a single protein diet  so all he can have is seafood  i thought these would be perfect for his nightly dinner  but unfortunately he is not a fan  they look to be high quality and if he would eat them i would have kept ordering them  not to worry the ones he will not eat have gone to feed my mom s feral cat 
quality	the inside cats will not eat it  even the outside cats would not touch it 
product	i thought my 4 cats would love this brand for sure  but not anything with sardines on it  it is just too boney and very sharp  cats licked the sauce and left most of the fish intact  i tried to de bone these sardines but it just got too messy and still plenty of thorny bits that break down with the sauce  will not buy these again  disappointed 
product	i did not realize when i purchased this that this product is actually manufactured in thailand  i was caught off guard b c i read the usda plant  i will not be purchasing again 
quality	the only reason i gave it a  bad review  is  my cats are terrible eaters and they ate the first can but will not touch it now  i am sure most cats would love it  just not my cats  it has chunks of fish in it and i am sure it smells great to them  again  not my cats 
quality	my cat is very very fussy and she will not eat the big chunks of salmon in the salmon cutlets and i have another cat who will eat anything so it may just be her 
quality	cats do not like most flavors  especially the tuna  was excited that there was a variety pack  but unfortunately my cats are not excited about the food 
quality	this looks like a quality product at a reasonable price  but my cat does not like it  she eats half of what i put out  but i may try the other tiki pack  she might prefer the chicken concoctions 
quality	first of all  our cat is a little picky when it comes to  wet  cat food  she loves all the flavors in the queen variety  so we decided to buy this one  fully expecting it to be no problem  about half of the tins will be donated to our local cat shelter  as she simply did not eat them and went straight to her dry food  she did not even try some of them  just sniffed and turned her back to it  i will stick with the queen variety pack and tuna flavors  which she loves 
quality	i ordered a lot of the tiki cat cans and our cats will not eat it  they sniff it and quickly exit the kitchen  i have never seen them so completely turned off by any other cat food  it really smells horrible  and cats rely on odors  they will not eat any of the entire variety i ordered  i certaninly will not order it again 
health	nothing wrong with this cat food   my cats just would not eat it  sniffed it   then turned their backs and walked away from every can i opened  one cat with ibs sensitive stomach actually threw up the food right after eating it  but nothing wrong with the food itself   only thing i did not like was the intense smell   could smell it all the way in other room while it was sitting out 
product	first off  i will admit that i did not realize this was a seafood only mix  i was recommended to try the tiki cat foods by someone else  and for the foods i did look at the ingredients on  i was impressed  however  i did not look at all of them  and apparently did not check any of them in this mix  not all of these are grain free  and some of them have really large chunks of fish  which my cats refuse to touch  it would be nice if the ingredients for all of the varieties were listed here instead of having to hunt them down  my cats have eaten some of the tuna varieties  but everything else has been a waste 
quality	although this product has good ingredients and looked promising  my two cats absolutely refused to eat it  i would not say i do not recommend it  because it could just be my cats  taste preference  but for me  it was a waste of money  i thought that the variety pack would enable me to pick out what they like best for a future order  but they liked none of it 
quality	the cat food has big chucks of meat and lots of gravy  my cats love the gravy but will not eat the meat 
quality	sugar foot doesn’t like this type  she eats all the rest of the friskies canned food  but this meaty bits  she turned her nose up to it  wud not eat it  had to give to my sister for her cat  now she loves it 
quality	the cats do not like the beef bits  but they will lick the gravy up 
quality	my boys do not like those big pieces that much  they lick the sauce 
product	left a review a month ago and it is still not posted  cans are consistently dented to the point that gravy is dripping out of the cans  chewy customer service is wonderful    they replace the cans free of charge  but the replacements are dented as well  read the reviews chewy     fix your issues 
product	the outside package was correct but when opened only 1 flavor was inside 
quality	nothing wrong with the product at all  we just have very fussy cats  they love the sauce but will not eat the bits of meat  i will stick to the pate  brands 
quality	lots of gravy  smells good  but purina is not the best brand if you want long term healthy cats  i was hoping to steer them  my two 18 year old cats  away from tuna  not good for chronic kidney failure   i am looking for something to mix in with their prescription food  so far i have tried neo  blue  sheba and now friskies  hate to knock the product just because my cats do not like it  your cats might like it  but for me  back to the drawing board   
quality	i had stopped buying bits because my cats did not eat the meat i have alot alot of cats and they did not eat it just this week i tried a box and now they eat everything thankyou
quality	unfortunately my cats will not touch this stuff    they are not all that picky but just really do not like it 
product	i have 7 cats and 1 feral  not one of them ate this food    not even my feral stray outdoor cat    waste of money   i don’t recommend at all   
product	pate toppers are usally my orange cat s favorite  she sniffs this and walks away  or tries to bury it  must be a bad batch   
product	this seems somewhere between the expensive foods in pretty bags containing everything but the kitchen sink  including things of dubious value to cats   and the stuff based more on vegetable proteins and packed with carbs  including some grain free foods   i actually mix this with a somewhat higher grade  lower carb dry  and provide it in addition to wet food mealtime  one thing about this one is that it is a bit smellier than our other chicken based food  maybe the beef fat and yeast   but both cats appear to like it  although in some ways it can be good to go with smaller manufacturers  it seems like at least a couple of the big ones have upped their game in terms of quality control tech
health	i have outside strays that have made me their home  gave them this food as a better cheap food option and one kitty is getting sick now  i am now feeding them the expensive stuff that i feed my insiders  so this food did not work for them  but they did like it
quality	this surprised me  they have eaten this food in the past  but maybe it was a different variety pack  frodo and twinkle will not even taste 2 of the flavours a and just kind of push the salmon flavour around  they are not eating it this time  the feral kitties are getting some good food now    but we normally feed them a less expensive brand 
health	i bought this only because a new addition to our pet family will currently only eat this brand and flavor  i will not feed it to my other 8 cats and will transition the new cat off quickly  blue buffalo  freedom and blue are highly processed  have many harmful and unhealthy chemical additives and is consistently rated equivalent to cheaper grocery store brands  for the price  there are many better choices 
product	too many damaged cans  no wonder it’s cheap  all boxes of cat litter leaked too  substandard quality 
quality	good value to mix with the fancy feast salmon  grilled  the best before date is likely 2yr from manufacturing  recent batches  2019 02  watery after minutes  smells acidic after a while  cats will not touch 2019 06  stable  smells fishy after a while  doh  it is salmon 
quality	i purchased a small sample of this food which my elderly siamese seemed to enjoy  choosing the larger package seems to have been a mistake ~ she eats some of the mixer after long hesitation  and she will not touch her normally likable wet food buried beneath the scattered mixer resting on top 
quality	my cat wouldn’t even go near it  i tried giving him the boosters several times in his bowl  outside his bowl    but he isn’t interested 
health	i did not realize when i ordered it that it was freese dried  i am currently trying to switch my oldest feline over to the refridgerated chicken form  she is a very fussy eater  she gags herself on a whim  making herself vomit  much like a bulemic  i have to provide privacy for her to eat  but most recently we have learned that we have to leave the door open some so that if she decides that she is going to vomit her meal back up  she can run for the bacement  she likes a variety of flavors  but can decide on a whim that she is not going to eat that flavor that day  so neither of my cats were about to eat the freeze dried mixers  not even if i mashed them up and  resented them in granular form
quality	i had high hopes that our cats would love this but  no  they didn t  i added it to their regular dry food and they tried it  then ignored it  they love chicken and eat freeze dried chicken  in this mix there is veggie flavors that they do not like  i will keep adding it to their dry food in hopes that they will adjust to it  we will see how it goes 
quality	my cat refused to eat this  disappointing as she needs nutritional improvement 
quality	i purchased this product due to the information provided thinking it was superior to other dry cat foods  my cat baby would not eat it so gave it to another resident in my apartment complex that has cats  not saying the product is not good but if my cat would not eat it  wasted my money  this has nothing to do with chewy as i use them to order special cat litter 
quality	raw food is great if your pet will eat it  mine won t  part of the problem with this food is that the pieces are way too large for a cat s mouth  should be about half this size  similar to a cat s kibble  my cat licked it to test it  but then would not eat it and selectively ate around it  i broke them in half  still no interest  however my cat is normally picky  so you may have better luck  it is good the bag is small  will donate the rest of this to a local shelter 
quality	my cats are not interested in eating these  i think it is because they do not have any smell  also  they appear to be hard to chew and i think expand in their stomachs 
quality	my tiffany doesn’t really care for this  not saying my cat won’t eat this but it doesn’t appear to be something she really cares for  she will not eat it if i give it to her on its own but will eat it if it is provide as part of her meal 
product	i bought this thinking my cats would like it but they barely touch it absolutely horrible and waste of money for how expensive it is not to mention i cannot get a refund
quality	my cats do not like this so they do not eat and even touched this    
quality	i have 7 very fussy cats  they turn their noses up at premium foods  so i poured some of the topper broth from chewy  clean plates  
product	i was buying the evo chicken formula for my 2 ragdolls and then evo decided to only sell to retailers with standing stores  i tried this new food because from a quality standpoint it should be a great premium substitute for the evo but my 2 ragdolls decided they would rather starve  even my 17 pounder   nothing would coerce him to eat it  chewy is so awesome though that they refunded me the money and asked that i donate it to my local shelter 
quality	when i recently changed my cat over to canned food  i tried numerous brands  purrfect bistro chicken paté is the only one she would eat  so i purchased all that i could locally  placed an order with chewy for 2 cases  but the first can opened seemed a different consistency  she would not touch it  i compared the old and new can and they are different  why did merrick change  i am really worried now  what will she eat  
quality	my cats are super picky eaters  yet they have loved merrick’s for years that we thought we are finally done trying to find the food we need for our fur babies  starting with 2019  all of a sudden the cats started to hesitate when come food time  we have to hand feed them for about an hour for them to finish the bowl  the  the color of the food turned slightly grey  then most recently they switched over to aluminum cans and the cats officially stopped eating the food  no matter what we do they refuse to touch the food  we switched to a new food recently and they are doing great on it  would’ve loved to keep getting merrick’s    
health	they are eating most of it  it is rather dry  perhaps merrick could investigate increasing palatability without adding a lot of unhealthy ingredients like salt or sugar 
quality	though the ingredients look really good  my cats did not like it  i took away the dry food option hoping they would at least try it  but they just sniffed it and walked away  it was not as moist as other canned food either 
quality	i recently had to make some changes to my cat s diet  switching to wet food   so in order to find stuff he would eat i bought a huge variety of different cans  one each  and tried each one  he seemed pretty happy about eating the first can of this and one other type  so i ordered a selection of both from chewy  now only did my cat have absolutely no interest in eating any more of this food after that first can  he reacted very negatively and would not even let me hand feed it to him  let alone eat it on his own   but the other cat in our house  who is something like a garbage disposal when it comes to food  had the same sort of reaction  he happily devoured 1 4 of the can  then refused to touch
quality	my cats ate this food for quite a while  however a few months ago the food which did have a fresh meaty smell changed and is now a different color  texture  and smells odd  some of my cats will eat but reluctantly  others will not touch  i no longer buy
quality	my cat seems to like this  the other one still will not eat canned food  i bought this because the small cans of newmans own have been unavailable for several months  i think my cat prefers that one  and will switch back to newmans own if the smaller cans become available again 
product	is this supposed to be a pate  i am wondering if i received a bad batch because this is not pate at all   its like a brown weird looking mixture that is more a soupy pate then an actual pate  is not solid at all and i have opened several cans already  i purchased it because of the reviews and the kids seem to like pate best but not sure about this one 
quality	my bengal cat absolutely loved the bg chicken so i was disappointed when i saw that it was being discontinued  i ordered a case of the merrick purrfect bistro grain free classic chicken pate cat food and opened the first can of the case today  luckily  i had a number of cases of the old formula  when i opened the can  it had a strange smell which the previous formula did not and my cat would not touch it at all  kira will try most any food  so to have her not touch it at all was a surprise to say the least  i have no idea what to buy for her now 
quality	my guys did not care for this selection  shreds too big  i had to cut up the portion for them  they ate a bite or two 
quality	my cat will pick at this sometimes  but she really does not like chicken  i purchased this because of the beef  she loves beef  but she really does not like this  it looks like there is a lot more chicken in it than beef  if it would have been a 50 50 mixture of chicken vs  beef i believe she would have like it  not enough beef in it for my kitty 
product	package was open and taped shut with a chewy sticker  box was missing 3 packs of food
quality	not my cats favorite at all  a small nibble but they will not eat it 
product	to small of can  per oz size  pricey  vet food about the same price per oz 
quality	my cats eat the purina proplan plain turkey and giblet can  my girl had a uti episode so that i would do a little alternating  they do not like this recipe as well  although i beleive it is a better choice for urinary maintenance  thank you chewy
product	let us start by saying we love chewy  our cats are picky and will not typically eat a pate   i try and feed them healthy products but  again  they are picky  i ordered this because it appeared to be a little more healthy than the fancy feast  my issue is that the picture does not appear to be pate  and nowhere in the description is it listed to be pate   couple that with the need to order a full case you can understand the waste of money  this is not my 1st time running into this  good news  the cat shelter gets donated foods 
product	he ate some but was not really wild about them  admittedly  a minority opinion  they are very airy  almost like styrofoam  not even as dense as popcorn  they come with a lot of small crumbs  almost powder  consequently  a very expensive treat 
quality	my cats would not touch these  even my shrimp loving kitty casper  turned his nose up 
quality	i thought because of the small size and texture of these treats my cats would like them  they sniffed them and walked away  one cat did come back and eat them all  i will offer to them again and give it more time 
quality	i got 2 cats who are crazy about shrimp but they will not eat this  i gave it other people cats and they will not eat it either 
quality	my 3 cats would not eat these even though they smelled shrimpy 
health	i do appreciate hypoallergenic treats since my old kitty has many allergies  but neither kitty would eat these 
quality	my cat would not touch these  she would smell them and walk away 
quality	my cat will not eat them  please do not send anymore  but i love chewy and will continue using this service
quality	pdelivery was right on time which was great my cat likes his food but would not touch the treats they were really big and did not smell that great  rep was very understanding when i called and they credited my account back great customer service
quality	cat will not eat them  treats are too large and too hard  smaller soft treats might help 
quality	not sure if i got a bad batch or what the issue is but neither of my cats would even lick the food  the strange thing is  this is their favorite flavor of this brand of food  when i purchase it at my local retailer they eat the entire bowl  tried 6 cans out of the case and they would not touch it  went to my local retailer and bought a can and they ate it as usual  contacted the manufacturer and they swear formula has not changed  not sure what the issue is 
health	i can say after switching them up from whatever costco brand wet cat food to earthborn  they do not throw up nearly as much  they like the seafood and fish varieties  just not the chicken 
quality	so far my cats are not eating this food   will continue to try at a later time and give more feedback 
quality	my cats like this if they have not eaten it in awhile  it is just another good smelling cat food in the rotation pile 
quality	my cat has been a grain free eater   she usually eats earthborn fish in the can  lately  she is been leaving some in the dish  so i thought maybe a change was in order  she will not even touch the chicken catcciatori   so i guess i have to stick with the fish 
quality	the food may be good but my cats do not like shredded cat food  they prefer something a little more like a chunk of meat or more gravy 
product	will not buy sheba anymore  too much salt is not good for my cat
product	the packaging is horrible and you are paying more and getting less  not chewy’s doing
quality	i am sure this is good but my cats did not like it  i will give it away  they are used to the turkey chicken bag  gave low rating since did not eat it so hard to rate it
quality	cats do not like this flavor or texture  other sheba they love  i will purchase it  love chewy
product	i have been purchasing this food in cans for over two years  i have 2 siberians  and they love the food  however  sheba changed their packaging recently and it is awful  in order to remove the top foil  i end up getting the liquid on my fingers and hand  once that happens  i can no longer grip the foil  it is obnoxious  i am trying another brand of cat food that is still in cans this month to see if they like it  also   to manufacturers moving to this new packaging  these are not recyclable in my area  the cans were 
quality	i give it 3 stars only because the sheba turkey pate has not been reliable  my cat loves some turkey pate perfect portion trays but some he would not touch  even though they are from the same batch  it is still a great value for a fish free and grain free wet food for finicky cats 
health	i cannot really give an accurate view on this product as yet  i only got it the other day and have just started to mix it with the dry food my furbabies were using  i will need a few weeks to see if this works for my one cat that vomits frequently  he is why i picked the sensitive digestion food  i am very much hoping it will work for him  it was recommended to me by a vet tech 
health	i do not know what is in this food – the cat seems to enjoy eating it  i just do not enjoy cleaning it up after he does  he vomits more now    
health	i probably would have been better off purchasing an 8 pound bag vs 15  my cats do eat it but not as much as the prescription hills  i’m ok with this as now they’re eating more of the wet food  while they loved hills they hardly throw up with royal canin  that makes me happy 
product	cats did not like this at all   will not buy again 
product	the old formula   see the can on the review page   was liked very much by my kitties who usually only like pate  the shreds were thin and shorter  i would add just a tad of warm water for extra sauce  however  i just ordered a case with the new packaging  unfortunately  it is also a different formula  the shreds are thicker and longer and the sauce is less so chicken is drier  even my nick who usually gets a urinary prescription food did not want to finish it  he loved the old formula  why do companies change what was doing so well  i found a few cans of the 2 8 oz today  nothing else in other stores  so disappointed  i think a few other reviewers may still be commenting on the old formula 
product	wellness changed the recipe and formulation and now  what used to be my cat s favorite food  is now disgusting it used to actually be real shredded chicken and turkey  now  it is long pieces of processed meat with very little chicken  very disappointed 
quality	my two cats sniff and walk away when i open this food  they will not touch it  i hate to waste so i offered it to some hungry feral cats in my neighborhood  they would not touch it either  do not buy   
quality	i read about this food it had 4 5 stars so i thought i’ll try it because i have an overweight kitty and i thought this would be a good way to trim the fat a little bit and maybe give him some moist food he’d love  i have six cats all of them hate this food two cats ate a couple bites and then walked away nobody would eat it         nobody  so i guess now the raccoons are going to have some very expensive food to eat and one minute to rehydrate more like seven minutes and yes i followed the directions exactly i only mixed up one and a half cups with three quarter cups water and it took about seven minutes to rehydrate and again six cats nobody liked it  an epic fail    bummer 
quality	my two do not like this at all even when mixed with their regular canned food  so weird  i have a rough time with the smell  i’m going to donate this to a friend whose cats hated too but put it out for the raccoons who visit her yard and love it 
product	when i received this item  half of the bag was not even in nugget form anymore  it was all smashed and powder like  the cats did not really dig it either
quality	unfortunately  my cat will not touch this food  especially when wet  sad it does not work for her  as the ingredients are great 
quality	my cats will not eat it  very expensive for the fact that they don’t like it  i shouldn’t have ordered this product with out trying a smaller package of it at the store  i will not be getting any food from you until i try a smaller package of it to see if they like it 
quality	my two cats do not care for this one  i am not sure why but they will not eat it 
health	tried this formula for my cats on a recommendation from a friend  mixed it with their regular food and 3 of my 4 cats got sick eating it  my vet said she did not recommend blue buffalo due to the high number of recalls on their various products and we have switched them to another brand since  no more sick cats  cannot say it is bad food but i will not risk my cats on another blue buffalo product 
health	my cat enjoyed the taste and gobbled this food up  unfortunately  this did not correct all ibs symptoms and she continued to have diarrhea while on this food  we even used up the whole bag to see if her symptoms improved  and they did not 
health	after doing blood tests and then trying  without any luck  antibiotics and fortiflora to cure simon s diarrhea  this prescription food was vet recommended to possibly help with his digestion problems which end with diarrhea  the food seems high quality and looks like it would be easier to digest  however to my disappointment  simon turned his nose up at it  by not eating it  he is not helping his problem  so he still has diarrhea  i am running out of options to try  the 3 stars is because he did not eat it  a different cat may love it  so the food may be 5 stars 
health	i can only say the experience i have with my cats   one who needs hydrolyzed food and one who does not but has to eat it anyway  after a few weeks  neither of them like this food but eat it because it is the only option i am giving them these days  the one cat who has ibd persistent vomiting has not shown any improvement or change from when she was on science diet z d ultra  could work for others though 
health	the vet specialist wants my cat to eat just this for 8 weeks  he does not like it and will hardly eat it and begs and does everything to have something else  i cannot afford to not have him eat or go without eating as he has been losing weight due to ibd  i am hoping to maybe find another brand  i accidently bought the royal canin hp which he liked  but he cannot eat  that went right through him  i been trying anything to find a food he can tolerate  not much luck  i have 2 other cats who wont eat this food  1 tried it and then she vomited it up  i have not noticed her eating it lately and the 3rd cat did not even try it  they have their own food anyway where the 1 with issues cannot get to  love
quality	my cats would not eat the cans of beef n chicken  they did not like it at all  all the 12   24 cases have this can in it so i could not order this item  it is a shame as this case was the most economical for my budget  also the hooded litterbox i purchased a month ago  my cats do not like it and refuses to use it   i had to go back to their old rectangular pan 
quality	nothing wrong with the food  however my kitty cat does not like it  he prefers the shredded chicken 
quality	he needs to have this diet loves the dry but does not like this one bit  so i trying one with gravy 
health	i have tried several brands of urinary tract formula cat food  my cats do not like any of them  i am giving up and switching back to regular cat food 
health	i do not like the carrageenan and the by products  but this is one of the very few canned foods my kitty with urinary tract issues  specifically idiopathic cystitis  eats with gusto  the best thing you can do for any cat  especially those who have uti s  is get as much wet food into them as possible  of course this cat is a hard core dry food addict  and is very picky about canned food  my attempts to give him top quality grain free wet food have mostly failed  so i am ready to just give him what he likes  and be glad he is at least getting the moisture that he desperately needs 
quality	i purchased to try on my indoor cats  they will not touch it  so i am bringing to feral cats today  hopefully someone will eat it  finicky finicky
quality	i bought this gf dry cat food for my two cats  our vet wants them transitioned to gf food and i have been greatly successful with the merrick gf canned purrfect bistro  our cats have been all over the canned purrfect bistro but it was paws down on this merrick dry food  not sure if it was the sweet potato or what but they refused to eat it as a mixer in the regular dry food they were supposed to be transitioning from  they ate all around it  head scratching for sure 
quality	my cat and i really liked this product for a long time  i respect merrick  but this was a disaster  it had disintegrated into a sawdust texture with maybe 10 percent of the bag being nuggets  first time  but he would not eat it 
quality	the two meows in my house have been eating and thriving on merrick real chicken recipe for several years now  however  it appears the formula has been changed and it now comes with chicken and sweet potatoes and they will not touch it  one tried to bury it and the other sniffed and walked away this is a slight problem 
quality	my cats are really enjoying this food  but it is very crumbly and it seems like a lot goes to waste because they are not eating the powder crumbs that settle in the bowl  another reviewer mentioned that this happened once to them but it is not always the case  maybe it gets broken down in transport 
quality	we ordered this cat food in the 7lb bag and it was fine  cats ate it  ordered the 12lb and half the bag was powdered food  the cats refused to eat it because it was so powder  not sure if we just got a bad batch out of the partner heavy bag was just bad 
quality	i am sure that it is a great product but my picky cats would not eat it  i am going to donate it to the rescue center 
health	my cat loves the food but he has an allergy to something in this product  i noticed him coughing almost like they do when they have a hairball  i started brushing him more often but by a process of elimination  i discovered it is this food  so you may want to start with the smallest bag and see how your cat does on this product  i am no longer purchasing this for my cat 
quality	my two boys have been enjoying this food for quite a while  i recently opened a new bag and one of them stopped eating it  ok  cats are finicky  no big deal  now the other has lost interest as well and he will devour anything  i googled the brand and find out merrick sold to nestle in july  of course they promised not to change anything  but       
product	no idea what is wrong with the food  my cats only ate the first case  24 cans  and changed their mind  now they hate this food and would be hungry for a whole day rather than eat it  i have 2 cases left and have to mix this wet food with other brand  fortunately  my cats accept the mixture food  would not buy again 
health	we tried feeding my dog blue buffalo but when we were switching him over with the mixing it with the old food it gave him explosive diarrhea  he was fine with the old food but blue was not agreeing with his system 
product	none of my dogs will eat this  seriously disappointing seeing all the money i spent 
health	looking for dog food that can be eaten by both my pups  our older boy has food allergies  so limited on ingredients we can get and since feeding two big dogs  need quantity that they will eat and not break the bank  this one we had to add  stuff  to to get them to eat  so we keep looking 
product	i was happy to receive the package in the mail  i had just run out of food after feeding my dog in the morning  it was very convenient to come home and have this waiting instead of having to run to the store on the way home  when i opened the box however  i found red tape on the bag of food with the word  rejected  on it and after peeling back the tape a huge gash in the bag  i was extremely unhappy to discover they wounld send a product in that condition  needless to say it was my first and last time using the website 
product	this is my first time having a dog and immediately once i got her transitioned her over to blue  i have been feeding her blue buffalo food for two years  i was disappointed when i recently found out there was a lawsuit against blue claiming there was toxic lead levels in there food  i just wanted to let everyone know so you can look into the food and maybe consider switching personally i switched my dog to orijien 
quality	i got this as a trial for my girls  as i have heard a lot about it  it was ok  but my little dogs would not touch it  my lab liked it but for the cost  i will not purchase it for just one  your guy will either like it or not  there is no maybe about it 
quality	i read great reviews on this brand but my dogs will not eat at all  even when mixed with canned food they won’t eat it  first time i ever that they won’t eat at all
quality	i have two older small breed dogs needed small bites this was that and so well rated high number of people my dogs hated it would not eat it  
product	i am trying to transition two my dogs from a more expensive brand to bb to save a little money  bb appears to be a high quality food  and likely a better value  no problem with dietary issues  but one of my gsds does not finish it all without coaxing  its a wait and see at this point  she does have dietary issues  problems gaining weight  but she typically feeds quickly 
health	switched my dogs food about a few weeks ago and did it the proper way  after a full week on this food both my dogs have been farting and diarrhea every day  great ingredients but somethings up with this food 
quality	she actually separates the bb size pellets and will not eat them  i am going back to fromm 
quality	my dogs love blue buffalo  but the bag that came in must be old because they will not eat it   they smell it and walk away   one even covered it up with dirt and leaves 
health	i have 2 labs that loved the food  the first 2 bags were great but that changed with the 3rd bag  after feeding the dogs from the 3rd bag for 2 days they developed really bad stomach issues with lots of gas and runny stool  this went away quickly after changing to a different brand  then i tried to introduce the 3rd bag back in and issues returned  after reading many other reviews and complaints of a similar nature  i have bought my last bag of blue buffalo 
health	i have been feeding my 4 dogs blue buffalo dry and wet food for a long time now  i took my boxer to a new vet the other day for an ear infection  thinking i am feeding my dogs and cats the best product for them  she told me she used to feed her animals the same thing  until they and her clients that fed them blue buffalo too all developed crystals in their urine  it had become quite a common occurrence at her practice  so now i am switching to another dog food brand  i just wanted you to be aware of this  because i was so blown away by this news  i hope this help you too  i certainly do to want my babies to have this happen to them  good luck
product	my bag had very big chunks that did not get turned into kibble  makes me wonder what other things were ignored  i have pictures if you are interested  i was very disappointed
quality	my dogs are picking out the little dark pieces of food and leaving them all over around the food dish   they refuse to eat them   for the amount that i paid for the food   there should not be any waste   i am going to go back to taste of the wild  
quality	this product sounded great  however  my dog will not eat it  i have tried mixing it with other food he normally eats  i have tried sprinkling it with cheese  he will not eat it 
quality	i’ve been buying this dog food for my two dogs for about 6 months and they liked it at first but then they stopped eating it  so we switched to a different brand   they’re eating a lot better now 
quality	dog ate a little from the first bag  but now refuses to eat any  even if mixed with people food 
product	i am only on my second day of feeding so it is hard to give a full rating  the process for delivery was great and fast  the food seems to be good  my small bichon frise seems to like it  i only rated 3 stars because we are only on day 2 
quality	i recently switched after a recipe change on my dogs  old brand of food  during the mixing phase of changing their food  they seemed ok with this one so i bought a second bag  now they push the bowl around and will not eat it until they are hungry  now to try another brand of food 
quality	going by the reviews my dog should have been doing back flips instead of backing away  charley really does not like this stuff  he will only eat it grudgingly when he cannot hold out any longer due to hunger  this is expensive dog food so he is going to have to eat it  i will not be reordering taste of the wild 
product	i am a big fan of this food for my dog  but i am disappointed that they downsized their 30 lb bags to 28 lbs and are still charging the same amount of money 
product	they recently changed bag sizes and my dog will no longer eat this food  i looked at the label and tried looking online to see what they changed but did not find anything  perhaps the new packaging has chemicals that changed the taste   either way we are switching 
health	i have 2 senior labs both hate this food so much they will not eat  if i trick them into eating it they tend to get sick  one has thrown it up twice  i bought this to give them quality food but if they will not eat it ever it does not matter how high the quality 
quality	my dog took one sniff and walked away  would not go near it and he eats everything  chewy is awesome and took care of it 
health	bentley ate his first serving but refuses to eat it even if i put chicken in it  just eats the chicken  funny really cause he will eat the science diet weight loss diet but not this which smells horrid  he is never not eaten a bowl of food  he seems to like the can food we ordered  so it is no all bad  waste of money though 
quality	was hoping our picky eater would like this but he will not rich it so we tried giving it to our boxer   which is not a picky eater and she will not eat it either
quality	i bought this hoping the pieces would be larger than the food they currently eat  unfortunately the pcs  were the sam e size  however my dogs did not like the taste of this food anyway  glad i only bought 5 lbs to try  the ingredients look good  do not really know why they do not like it  but they spit out most after licking the wet food off  i had mixed with their current food so at least they got some food  i knew it was the new food they spit out because it was the darker of the 2 foods  sorry 
quality	my dogs are not eating it as well as they did the food i had them now before  i was thinking about calling and switching them back to the food i was getting before 
product	this is the third time that my bag has arrived ripped and food spilled all over the box  the first 2 times were not too bad but this time almost half the bag was spilled out  i love everything else about chewy com but this is getting annoying
quality	i have four dogs   2 great danes and 2 dachshunds   not one will eat this food  i bought 2 bags of the buffalo and one of the salmon  the dogs will not touch either kind  they push the bowls to the side and would rather go hungry  now i have to order 3 new bags of dog food 
quality	i’ve fed my dogs other grain free dry food but this they would not eat   
quality	rebel really does not care for it sound like he would of but for some reason i was wrong
quality	will not eat it  they eat it only when way too hungry  i am going to return it  it costs too much to just throw it away 
quality	as far as wolves they do not eat peas  beans or potatoes of any kind  they are more likely to munch on grass and wheat that grows in the grass and other seeds that are found in grass in the wilderness  besides of course a fresh kill  so grain free  not for me 
health	the ingredients list looks great  i was not worried about giving this to my pupper  after 6 years he is gone from kibble from the grocery store to blue buffalo he ended up getting sick from that  and after that i tried this  it was highly recommended so i am sure other dogs love it but mine sniffed it and was immediately like repulsed   he will literally eat poop   
health	my female dog is hard to please with most dry foods  she always wants what my male dog gets and has been able to get it if i turn away  but he is a really sick boy and gets only prescription dog food dry and canned and it is very expensive  both of my fur babies are quite large and unfortunately they both cannot have his kind 
quality	this food is probably fine  but our dog does not like it 
quality	previously bought this brand before and she liked it   bought a 30lb bag and a 30lb bag of blue buffalo that she used to eat  she will not touch either of them  very upset 
quality	my 3 year old had been on the puppy version until a few months go    now i just ordered for the 2nd time  this adult bison blend and he is not chowing down like he used to  took him to dr and could not find anything wrong    wonder if they have changed the mix of ingredients or if others have found a difference in recent bags  he is just not eating it   
quality	took 11 days to gradually introduce new food to dog  he has stinky gas and actually pooped in the house  something he never does  other dog just has diahrria 
health	the only reason i rated a two stars was because my 7 month old lab did not tolerated it at all  i try to spaced it out for 5 days but could not go further than 1 2 cup of the new to 1 1 2 cup of the old  he was used to chicken and salmon  so i am thinking that it was too strong for him  at the the 5th day he developed diarrhea and vomiting  it was bad  maybe i will try it again when he is older 
quality	my 5 month old mini schnauzer will not eat this food  hate it as it was a waste of money for me 
quality	trying to get our border collie into some other type of food other than fish  she does not seem interested any more  we thought we would give this a try  started with a small bag  not interested  i do not think it is a bad dog food  just something that my mia does not enjoy 
product	i am weening my one year old german shepherd of the more expensive orijen large breed puppy food  he is a picky eater  seems to be adjusting to taste of the wild  not crazy about dog food  any suggestions from anyone 
quality	we adopted an older dog who had been fed cheap grocery store dog food  he scratched his ears constantly and chewed his feet  he would not eat the food from the old dog food bag until the end of the day when he was frantic with hunger and had tried to get something off our table our out of the trash first  but then would barf it all back up and want to eat grass  we tried several foods and just from taste alone  this was the only one he was willing to eat  so we switched  it did not take long to see the puking stopped on this food  no more ear scratching  he was willing to eat it instead of hoping he would find something better  we have had him on it for a few months and overall we are pleased
product	you guys i have tried to get him to like it and unless i place a half a pattie of meat no dice  i wanted to know if you can give me full refund and i will buy the normal one i buy  after reading the reviews on this product i decided to give it whirl  bad idea  maybe a different breed would like it but not zeus 
quality	my dog would not even go near this food   i have never seen this happen before  i literally would not even eat one piece  i do not know what it was but had to throw it all out 
quality	i bought this product based on dogfoodadvisor s rating of 5 stars  all that excellent nutrition is worthless if the dogs will not eat it   i gave away about 45lbs of pricey dog food to someone who said their dogs would eat anything 
health	it must smell in edible to him because he will not eat it  and the one time he tried  he vomited it up within 2 minutes  waste of money 
health	we decided to switch our dog to totw and tried the wetlands variety first  which she loved  we then purchased a bag of the high prairie to get her a different flavor for a bit  and she was    unenthused  she did not seem too keen on it right off the bat  but ate it  a week or two later i noticed she was not eating her full meal in one sitting but was instead grazing periodically  which was really alarming and i thought she might be sick because that was so not like her  after this happened a couple of times and there was half her meal left in the bowl when she walked away the first time  i added a scoop of the leftover wetlands variety that she had  she inhaled every piece of it immediately and
quality	i like that the pieces were little but my yorkie would not eat it  the jack russell did but he eats everything 
quality	my dog is incredibly food motivated  he would eat anything  he has had to use a slow feeder his whole life  i switched him to sss after the grain free debacle and he wouldn’t even touch it  i heard such great things about this formula and was excited to try it  and i know it’s worked well for other dogs  my dog has never turned his nose up at food before  even my cousins’ dog’s kibbles and bits  and i couldn’t believe he wouldn’t eat this  he’s older so at first i thought it was something medical  but after 2 trips to the vet he was given the all clear  i was even mixing in wet food and gravy  he would lick off the wet food and spit the kibble out  after a few weeks of trying this we switched
health	unfortunately i had a problem with the dog food  it is never happened before i’m sure it is rare but there were some ants in it  it wasn’t totally infested but they were crawling around  i went through the food entirely and cleaned them out salvaging the food  the antler was the best ever  for some reason the dog liked it much better than previous antlers  it did an amazing job cleaning his teeth  sorry for the not perfect rating 
health	i have been feeding for a month and it says for sensitive stomach but has given my dogs horrible diarrhea but they eat well i just don’t like how it has been on them i’m hoping it will change
health	i purchased this food because i was concerned about the gluten free business and this looked like a nutritious food for my dog  he has a sensitive belly and i am guessing an allergy to chicken so this food looked like it would fit the bill  i have a lab  he loves meal time  always very excited to eat  however  he is just not a fan of this food  it is the first one i have found that he did not like    switching to the  savor  in the purina pro plan brand  hoping for a better outcome 
quality	i got this food before which she would eat  has not touched it since i got it again
health	the first two or three days she loved it and gobbled it up like she always does when i bring something you home  we splurged and bought this more expensive pro plan because was wanting to cater to her sensitive stomach and skin conditions  but she prefers the pedigree and then she gets tired of it after a few days also  i do not know what to do  
health	i was changing dog foods  not brands  because i suspected a chicken allergy in one of my dogs  i have used pro plan for 25 years and been extremely happy  few medical issues and usually at the end of life when it is normal  my vet also recommended it  i tried the salmon  one dog loved it the other spit it out  of course the spitter was the one i needed it for 
health	two of my dogs absolutely will not touch this food  i’m not sure why  my other two eat it just fine  i’m trying to find something for sensitive stomachs that they’ll all eat  i’m going to try to lamb formula next 
health	this food does help my dog with skin issues  he enjoys it and everything  i just am not a fan of the big loose stools he has while on this food  other then that i would strongly recommend
quality	my old girls just turn their noses up to this dog food  i keep trying various ways to get them to eat it     but  one dog is almost 14 and the other one is 9 years old  if they don’t like it    we will just go back to iams i guess  i was trying to save a little   and keep their sensitive tummies stable  ugh  oh well oh well    
health	this food has helped with my pups hacking and coughing issues and has helped with the vomiting  however  they still are being super picky when it comes to eating  i bought 2 30 lbs bags and they have hardly touched any of the 1st bag  i have to mix it with egg or gravy to even get them to eat  so  i am going to bight the bullet and give away the other bag and go back to royal cannon  thanks chewy for the help and recommendation but i do not know what else to do 
health	i was a bit frustrated when i switched to this brand because my order was canceled at the last minute on the other brand i was using  as you can imagine my dogs ran out of food and i had to start them on the new brand without mixing the two  never good   one of the bags in the box was open so the food spilled all over my floor       not happy  i was also disappointed with the size of the food  it is suppose to be for large dogs and this food is tiny  i bought this brand because my hound is always scratching and shaking his ears  i am hoping this helps as i believe he has skins allergies  i will try for a couple months 
health	we used to love this food as it seemed to be one of the few recipes that agreed with our chocolate lab s sensitive stomach  however about a month or two ago we noticed a change in the size of the kibble followed by our lab beginning to lick and chew her paws relentlessly  shortly thereafter  both our pooches began to turn their noses up at full bowls which is very unlikely for either of them  we have since switched to merrick s salmon formula and the skin issues have already begun to clear  i have heard that merrick was silently bought out by purina but is not planning on changing their recipes or quality of ingredients  hoping that holds true 
product	love the way they say purina is going thru some package changes  look closer folks  they went from 33 pounds to 30  still 42 00 dollars but you are getting 3 pounds less per bag  i am looking to change food  i have shown newfoundlands and fed pro plan for about 12 years  not at all happy about this  sneaky  package change 
product	i cannot believe that after reading all these reviews and taking a chance on this product  my dog is not doing well on it  i mixed it with his old food to transition him to it  about 50 50  it has been 2 weeks and i am giving up  back to his old food  his poop has not been firm on it which was a problem with all of the other foods except his old food  the big problem is he is itching on it  i thought this dog food was supposed to be for sensitive skin as well  it is so bad we have to put him on benadryl every 4 hours  none of the other dog foods did this  i am very disappointed with this food  i will be very reluctant to buy from purina again 
health	i ordered this particular blend as one of my little dogs  gracie dachshund  seems to have allergies which affect her skin  another of my dogs that never has had a problem began eating this  and by the second day  she started scratching really bad  they were getting only a small amount blended in with their other food  but i do not know of any other reason  liza schnauzer  would have started itching so bad  i honestly cannot rate this product now 
quality	i like this brand a lot but this flavor of food my dog will not even touch the cable is a lot bigger than he is used to but it is the flavor that does not like
quality	i bought the salmon for the promo but when opening the salmon it was wet n some mushy not sure if moisture got into it or not but  y dogs would not eat it and still haven’t  won’t order this again  def  not the salmon kind  had to open the beef one and throw the salmon one away  but it was delivered quickly and i’ll give that a two star
quality	fine ingredients and nutrient profile and great price  but my girls do not like the taste  we have been adding low sodium beef broth to make it more appealing to them  and while i would love to continue to support the company  we will not be buying it again 
health	if i could give “0” stars i would  my pups didn’t like this food  i bought 2 bags bogo free  i thought it was a great deal but my dogs when they heard me serving their food  they just walked away  i gave them salmon flavor first then the chicken days later but didn’t like any of them  i was so disappointed and sad i thought they were getting sick or something but no    they didn’t like this brand of food  i ended up giving it away 
quality	i really thought this would be a high quality dog food that my dog would love  she will not eat it on her first  second or third pass  when she is finally really hungry she will eat it  but that does not say much for this expensive dog food 
quality	good price for the food but all 4 of my dogs did not care for it 
quality	the first day i fed him this food he ate it  it is much more crunchy than other foods we have tried  the next day he refused  he is a dog whose stomach clock usually goes off about an hour before feeding time  and he eats with gusto  now he walks away from the dish and will not touch it until i put something on it  i tried warm water  and he ate it the first time  but after that he would let it sit for 12 hours before he gave in and ate it  i tried beef broth  olive oil and coconut oil  all failed  mixing tuna into it finally worked  i now am mixing in canned dog food with it and he is eating it  what a hassle 
quality	my dogs do not like maybe other dogs will but mine do not
quality	our 7 yr old boston is not fond of this food  she loves fish  she will sit and not eat unless we add her old food  guess we will not buy this again 
health	our dog has not been picky since we brought her home   but she barely chokes down this food  i bought it when it was on special  thought we would give it a try  experiment   failed  doggie is begging for her old food  she eats this  but only after it sits there for awhile and she realizes nothing else is coming  she will be happy when we bring back her old food 
quality	i would not order this food again  my dog absolutely refuses to eat her new food  i figured i would try it since it was a buy one get one deal to save some money  it was a waste of money since she hates it 
quality	my two english bulldogs do not care for this brand  will change back to regular brand 
quality	i can only speak for my dog  but she does not like this kibble  it is the first brand i ever bought that sits in her bowl all day and then she begrudgingly eats it  even my weird cat  that is always sneaking her dog food  does not sneak this out of the bowl 
quality	i was excited for my dogs to try this salmon and sweet potato  grain free recipe but almost immediately  they started turning their noses up to it  within a few days one would not eat it all and the other only ate the parts covered in canned food  defeating the purpose of purchasing the product in the first place  my dogs are usually that picky  hopefully  others do not have the same issue  since this is the first time both my dogs reacted the same way to a new product  i thought i would take the time to share my experience 
product	super disappointed  heard this was a great  quality food  which i’m sure that it is  but my dogs wouldn’t eat it 
quality	i bought this because it was a good deal  i was looking for a better gf food for my blk lab than i was feeding   was feeding gf victor  it was ok  most of the reviews seemed good  some were bad  but her coat feels like it’s starting to get matted   not soft like it did before  looking for another brand 
health	my dog reluctantly eats this stuff if i mix it with something like w d chicken stew with gravy  but he is getting sick of that too already  he tries to steal the neighbor s purina dog chow 
quality	this food was not what i thought it would be  my dogs took to it the first day but have stopped eating it  very disappointed in this product 
quality	he refuse to eat it  have no idea what is going on 
quality	while i am sure many dogs love this  mine did not  two of the three did not care for it at all  the third enjoyed it quite a bit  but still seemed to prefer the other brand 
quality	my digs will not touch this food  i have a huge bag now that they hate 
quality	my dogs would not eat this without topping it with a raw diet  i think it is probably a good choice but i think i will change back to their other food 
product	i have two different breeds of dogs and neither will eat this food  may be the flavor that they do not want but will not buy this brand anymore 
quality	i started out with the salmon and rice  my german shepherds loved it  i was not crazy about the rice so switched it to the salmon and sweet potato  i was less than impressed to find out the  salmon  formula contained chicken and turkey  oh well  i had already bought it and was slowly doing the switch  they switched over easily  as we got to just the salmon and sweet potato  my dogs got less and less interested in it  they would eat it  just not as enthusiastically as they did the salmon and rice  today  i fed one of them outside  i was shocked to find her eating a pile of poop instead of her food  she has never ate poop before  obviously she does not care for the food and or is lacking
health	my husband ordered this by accident while i was i n the hospital      blu gets the limited ingredient for her allergies  which is great   althought this is salmon and sweet potato it still has chicken in it  her stool is softer than normal but still formed      she really does not like it and tends to play with it for a while before deciding to eat
quality	needed to add a different food to my husky packs food because they get board with just one brand of food  this is not one they liked  some turned their nose up to it even mixed in with their staple brand they get all the time 
quality	i love chewy and i think the company is hands down the best pet supply company i have ever dealt with  with that being said i feel terrible about leaving one of their products a less than stellar review  after all the great reviews i went ahead and bought a bag of this to try  hey 50  off is too good to pass up   i really really wanted the two dogs to love this  unfortunately they did not  one is extremely picky but the other one is not  both of them refused to eat this food unless i mixed canned or something else in with it  the ingredients look great to me but if the dogs will not eat it then     sorry chewy    
quality	i have 2 dogs  a basset boxer mix who did not seem to mind the food  but my pit bull stopped eating  i tried this thinking maybe instead of an all fish product this might be better  the reviews were great  however it just must be something he does not care for  i am not saying i would not recommend it  just saying that my pit muct be picky  although he has never refused any other dry food before 
quality	i was looking to try something new for my dog  something that was of better quality and had better ingredients than what i was giving him prior  and since i have had nothing but positive experiences with chewy com in the past i thought i would give this a try  the price was good  i do not know what it is about this food  but he will not touch it  he walks up and sniffs it and then walks away  i will not be purchasing this product again  good value if your dog will eat it  mine will not touch it    
quality	my dogs seem to digest this food ok  but they do not like it at all  i will be mixing broth into it to bribe them until it is gone  i do not plan to re order this brand 
quality	our lab is 13 years old and we are having a hard time finding foods she will eat  we tried the american journey salmon   sweet potato recipe and she did not like it at all  i think the smell was too strong she would sniff it but would not eat a bite of it  ultimately we gave the bag to a neighbor who has a dog that will eat anything 
quality	a prebiotic and a sugar     i am trying to find a healthy dog food to switch my dog to  i fed her a little bit of this out of my hand and she loved it but i kept re reading the ingredients which seem pretty good except      i was told if you cannot pronounce  do not eat it  fructooligosaccharides is the 17th ingridient  i have been trying to research what this is and if it is healthy or not for my dog and i am reading controversial information about this ingredient also known as fos  i am not a vet or a scientist just a concerned pet owner  i read that this is a synthetic prebiotic that can help the digestive tract but some scientific studies showed a growth of  bad  bacteria if given long term
health	we had our dogs on this product for a while  they seemed to like it  but after hearing it has links to heart disease  and research we decided be best to move to another brand 
health	i switched to this food to help with my dogs food allergies but my dogs won’t eat it at all 
quality	for some reason my two goldendoodles do not like the salmon pacific stream tow variety  even if i put a little broth on it  they will eventually eat it if i leave their bowls down  and this is odd bc one of them is an eater  she is only two years old  so  i am switching back to the bison and deer variety  they seemed to like that much better and happily ate all of their food  i do wonder however  if tow has changed their recipe in the past few months bc they liked the initial bags i bought  it is the more recent bags  auto shipments  they are picky about 
health	i wanted to love this dog food so much because it came highly recommend  was budget friendly  and had the best ingredients for my pup with skin allergies  let me start off by saying my dog will literally eat anything  he really is uninterested in this food  takes him a solid 20 minutes to finish eating when he would be done eating in 5 seconds with other dog food  i have also noticed that my dog is severely constipated with this food  i feel so bad to see him strain  will have to try another salmon  grain free kibble cause this is not the one for him 
quality	we were really hoping for better results with the taste of the the wild pacific stream food    our pug  miss delta  will eat anything     but will not even try this food     we tried it straight   tried it mixed in with her old food    she drags the new stuff out of the bowl and leaves it on the floor    please advise as to how we can return for a refund     thank you i really do not want to leave a one star rating since other dogs may eat the food     i cannot say the food is bad     i can only say our dog will not eat it    
quality	i have 2 labrador retrievers that refused to eat this food  even when mixed with old food for a transition period  they refuse to eat it  they have been eating blue buffalo their whole lives but i wanted something a little less expensive  i read all the reviews   this seemed like a good option  i give it 2 stars because there was no awful smell   no concern other than my spoiled pups  just a waste of money for me  my dogs do not seem to care about cost  only taste  lol  so back to bb it is 
quality	my dog refuses to eat this flavor of dog food  sames name brand that i fed her before but just does not like the salmon flavo 
quality	my four dogs will not touch the stuff  they would rather go hungry  i am very disappointed in the salmon and buffalo flavors  my two danes and two dachshunds just push the bowls in the corner  they have not eaten in three days  i now have to go buy three new bags of food 
quality	my pitbull does not like it  this dog food will sit in the bowl all day  i will be trying a different brand and flavor now 
quality	first of all when you open the bag  the smell of the food is very overwhelming  i have two daschunds  one of them ate the food and seemed to like it just fine  the other one would not touch it  after two days of not eating the food  we decided to try adding water to the food to soften it up  and he ate it that way  after about a week  we noticed that our dogs started to stink  not just doggie breath    i mean really stink  we could smell them from two feet away  and  it all started when we starting feeding them taste of the wild  the smell got progressively worse and worse  the dogs became so smelly from eating the food that i had to throw half of a bag of the food away and go back to
quality	i have been feeding my puppy this brand puppy recipe and she gradually turned her nose from it  i figured it is time to switch to an adult recipe but still no luck  she does not like it  
quality	i have one pup that will not eat this food  the other two like it but do not love it 
quality	i bought a big nag of the dry food but my dog wont eat it  i tried mixing in his old food and still would not eat it  i wish i could return it 
product	the beautiful packaging does not reveal the tasteless chow of which it contains  3 different breeds snubbed it  i will stick with zignature  their fav 
health	i have been using totw for over a year now and love it  what i do not like is the current batch that made my dog very sick  i will wait a little while and reorder after some time passes
quality	my dogs do not like this food as well as nutro source  so will try another food next time
quality	not as good   dogs do not like it as much as they like nutrisource 
health	tried numerous brands with limited ingredients for my adult standard poodle with allergies  he either still had rashes or soft wet stools until i switched him to totw wild pacific stream  also the price is great for the quality of food 
quality	my dog will not touch it  it is not that the quality is bad  she just for some reason does not like this flavor  she likes the high prairie one so i thought that i would try this  i am going to have to send it back though 
quality	my two jack russell beagle mixes are not fans of this food  i tried to order some of the high sierra flavor thinking they would like it better and while they do prefer it  this is not a food that they like very much  i am hoping to find something else that they will actually enjoy  i wanted to switch them away from their old  low quality brand  on the plus side  my brother s large dog likes the food and he will be finishing out the bags for me 
quality	taste of the wild was kind enough to send us some free samples of this product and sofie  our very allergic boxer   dairy   chicken   ate them with no problem  so  we bought a large bag and now she half heartedly nibbles at it  she does not like it at all  so it is back to the drawing board  chewy’s prices and speedy service was outstanding and we will be purchasing the next bag from them 
product	i decided to try the auto ship for convienence ordering two bags  delivery was right on schedule but both bags i received were 1 and 2 months past the expiration date  i will not be buying product from this company again  no matter savings 
health	we have a 5 year old boxer that after 2 years of her life all of a sudden came down with allergies  we have tried so many types of food  this is one that was recommended to us by other dog owners that have animals with allergies  unfortunately  this particular brand made her worse  so we will have to try something else 
quality	it is only been two weeks and my girls coat is softer and shinny  but she is not eating it up like she dose the cheap brand but she is eating  i changed to this brand for her digestive problem and i think it is helping 
quality	i was somewhat disappointed that my dogs did not care for the taste of the wild pacific stream dry dog food  guess they just were not use to the fish taste  i am sure it would be good for them  i will stick with the bison flavor 
health	my dog has allergies  still unsure what it is  and i was told by the vet to switch her to a fish based food  she was eating blue buffalo chicken for small breeds before  i did extensive research and saw so many reviewers rave about this food and how miraculous the change in their dog was  they claimed it helped with their dogs  allergies  scratching and the frequency at which they chew at their paws  though i will admit it made my dog s fur very plush and soft  i saw no difference in her allergies or paw biting  i will have to test out another dry food 
product	i love the ingredients  and i had really hoped my dogs would  as well  i have 7 dogs  and none of them love this food  if i mix with wet food  they lick the wet food off and leave the kibble behind  i have wasted a lot of money on this food  and i am very disappointed 
quality	i must have tried 6 or more different dog foods since getting my second dog  now over two years ago  there always seems a downside  even to the super healthy holistic brands  at first  i thought totw solved all my problems  the main being cost  i just cannot pay  2 or more a pound for food for two big doggies  totw is a great quality food  but the different  flavors  i tried all made my dogs  breath smell  my dogs have never had  dog breath  until eating totw  the pacific stream formula also smells horrible  in addition  my german shepherd s coat condition declined on this food  he now has really flaky  dry skin  so  while i commend totw for offering a high quality grain free food at an affordable
quality	i know my sire eats cat food with fish but he does not eat this food 
quality	she will not touch it  no matter what i try to do to make it more tasty  i will end up donating this bag to a shelter and i will never buy this product again 
health	i changed food for an allergy that our rescue had with the food we were using  we switched to blue buffalo and now my other dog has an allergy
quality	i have purchased this brand and recipe before  but this time all three dogs would not touch it  i may be a bad batch 
product	ordered this because my pup loves blueberries   spoiledpup   he loves it  i mix it 50 50 with his other food though  because it is pricey 
quality	i love this food and my dogs thrive on it  however  that being said the  smart bits  are a complete waste of space and money  my  smart  dogs will not eat the smart bits and it makes a huge mess  i have asked blue if they can make a bag without them   i am that frustrated by it 
quality	this dog food is grain free but is loaded with dried fruit  which my dog will not eat  i am going back to caesar 
quality	have 2 small dogs  they sniffed it   turned around   walked away i bought another blue buffalo type that they seem to really like it is blue buffalo wilderness adult small bite chicken recipe grain free dry dog food
health	i will give this company credit for showing integrity and paying all my vet bills  however considering one of my dogs became very sick and the other one was starting to show the same symptoms i will never feed my dogs blue  apparently they made some changes after over 30 dogs became sick but it was too little too late for us  be very careful and check out the research that was done on this product especially if you own a herding dog 
quality	my 25lb terrier had previously been eating another bb grain free food  and i switched to this one after reading great reviews and seeing it on sale  his stomach handled the switch just fine  however  he was noticeably less interested in his food from the very first bowl and after about 2 weeks stopped eating it completely in protest  oddly enough  my sister had the same experience with her 60lb shepherd with this food as well  not sure what it is  but neither of our dogs were even remotely interested in this variety  perhaps we both have picky eaters  i switched back to my original bb formula and all is well again 
quality	my dog refuses to eat this food   he went 3 days without food   this was not cheap either 
quality	i have a shiba inu who is very picky with his food  i was really hoping he would like this because it has real chicken pieces in it and this product has really good reviews  he would just pick at the food and eat the chicken pieces  other times he would not eat at all  i am still in search of dog food that he would enjoy  when he was as little puppy  he enjoyed ting kibbles but now that hes an adult dog  i have not seen much dog food with small kibbles 
quality	dogs like american journey chicken better  tried this   they do not eat as well 
product	my dog loves getting chewy packages  the only issue is that you packed everything in one box that was way too heavy for most to pick up  that and leaving it at my garage door instead of front porch 
quality	he is very finicky    but he does not like this one  will continue experimenting with others
health	so i ordered the 40 lb bag of purina one smartblend chicken   rice formula adult premium dry dog food  my dog  sandy’s absolute favorite    i received it on 9 9 2018  the bag expiration date was 7 20 2018  i mean it’s dog food so i wasn’t really concerned that my dog would get sick or anything but i didn’t even notice this until a few weeks in  i was just disappointed honestly because it was such a giant bag of food and it should be able to have lasted much much longer  i only left 1 star due to the fast shipping and ease of buying the product from this website 
product	my items were priced for less than what local retailers in my area had them priced at  i received my order sooner than i expected  about 2 days   the box had a little damage but the contents were unaffected  i have scheduled repeat shipments to save even more money 
product	quite disappointed in product  very poor distribution of the chewy bits or just a lack of them  halfway through the bag and so far 97  dry kibble  all of the chewy bits can not be in the bottom of the bag  purina must be aware of this problem  the smaller bags i have purchased have had no problems 
quality	mu dogs do not care for it  i have to put canned food as a topper every time their fed  so they will eat 
health	our 3 dogs loved the dog food  but it gave 2 out of the 3 diarrhea 
quality	the first couple of days  my dogs ate it  buy they left a lot in their bowls  by the third day  neither would touch it  i even tried adding some canned food  but they still refused to eat it 
quality	changed from natures variety per my vet recommendation  due to heart problem scare  this is first dry dog food my shi tzu just flatly refuses to eat under no circumstances  tried pricy blue buffalo foil pouch toppers which he also refused to eat  got to find something else 
product	has animal fat  with no mention of specific animal   bad   fish meal unspecified species  garlic linked to heinz body animia  no probiotics  and it includes menadione omg  never buying again    
quality	my dog really likes this food  i am glad that it has grain  not just legumes or potato with the protein  however  it does not seem to meet the aafco so is not a big hit wit my dog s vet 
product	have to mix my  old  food with it till it is gone and will not buy again  my dogs like purina one dog food  why do not you carry it 
product	we have a large 140  lb purebred german rottweiler and was trying to find something different more natural to try for him  he has been on iams large breed and occasionally purina one large breed his whole life  6 years   the kibble of this food is ridiculously tiny compared to iams  a purina one  and the food includes tiny pellets that look like  and are the size of  rabbit poop  so he does not even eat much of them  or if he does he is just swallowing them whole  along with most the other food  he cannot even chew it  not buying this again  they need to make the kibble size appropriate for large breeds to actually be able to chew the food 
quality	my 2 large dogs do not like the flavor of this dog food
quality	    we bought two different bags and she did not eat either  wasted a lot of money  she used to eat this when we first rescued her  but she will not touch it now  yes we would recommend this because every dog is different and it has good ingredients  just buy a smaller bag to try first   even though she used to eat this before for some reason she will not touch either bags   this bag or taste of the wild high prairie and she ate it before  still wont touch it 
quality	purchased this due to the ingredients  unfortunately  my dog picked out all the  life source bits  and threw them all over the floor  she got to where she would not eat the food unless they were picked out   so  gave the large bag to my sister   oddly  her two dogs did the same thing  she said   they hate the little bits that are mixed in the kibble   so  three dogs all disliked the life source bits  which is a large portion of why you would buy the dog food  it was not the right food for either of our dogs 
health	i have had wonderful luck with royal canin food so when my dog got sick and needed to be put on a low fat diet i chose this food  my hopes were high that this food would be the one she would love but instead she turned her nose up at it  i was very disappointed because this food is quite expensive 
health	this food has helped with my dogs digestion issues but two of the cans received in my last order had mold when i opened the cans  i will try one more time but may be forces to get it from my vet next time 
quality	my dog has not been tested since starting this food  so i can not say if it is helping  but he has a hard time eating it  sometimes he tries to cover it up  he likes it best when you first open the can  but not so much after that  too bad it does not come in smaller cans  for me  it smells bad and makes the whole room smell  sure hope its working 
health	it’s good dog food but ridiculously expensive  i would prefer to keep my dog on it but i have other expenses like keeping a roof over my head  it’s really too bad it costs so much  i had to switch to a less expensive food  i feel like royal canin is taking advantage of the love people have for their pets by jacking up their dog food prices  they are no better than pharmaceutical companies that charge so much for medication 
product	i appreciate chewy s flexibility in ordering the amount i want when i want it  however  this is the second time that i receive cans that are dented  six very dented cans and several somewhat dented cans   it does not appear like they were dented in transit because they are interspersed with cans that are not dented  it s as though they were purposely evenly spaced among the 24 can pack   the first time was with another brand  
health	our vet suggested this food because of an issue with diarrhea from another food i was feeding our dog and was being used to settle her stomach intestinal tract  she just will not eat it unless coaxed  borderline forced fed  leaving me with cans of food sitting on the shelf  when you convert the wet ingredients to dry matter basis  this food has more fiber than she is been eating  the fat level is fine for her  however  in order for her to eat this food  we need to give her an endosorb  please note  the reason your vet might recommend this food will be for your dog s particular issue and i would follow your vet s advice 
health	one of my dogs has pancreatitis and was not doing well  after a blood test with abnormal numbers  the vet suggested putting her on this food  i was very upset because this food stands for everything i am against regarding dog food  i have always tried to feed my dogs the top of the line food and treats  clean ingredients  no recalls  etc   so this did not come easy for me  my dog is 13  and i did not want to lose her while i tried to search for food  i relented  and went with this food as an emergency  she is better  and not as many flare ups  she does not care for the dry at all  but loves the wet  i did mange to find a few alternatives with a low fat content   not as low as royal canin  but close
health	i have been using a salmon and sweet potato diet for years with my cocker  beyond  that has worked very well  but his ear infections and paw itching seemed to get worse so i thought i should try to get a better dog food for him  unfortunatley  this dog food has made his symptoms much worse  i will not be able to use this food and will have to try something else  maybe homemade food for awhile  my dogs did like the taste of this food 
health	my dog has really problems to adapt to this new food  i need him on a sensitive stomach diet  but he does not want to eat it at all  it is either the taste or the kibble size is too big
product	the kibble is large and a bit puffy  if you have a dog with an upset stomach  the kibble is a bit hard to digest  due to the size  which is why we use the canned version as well  i wouldnt recommend this size kibble for very small dogs  our dogs do like the flavor and readily eat it  the canned version always has crushed dented cans in the case of 12  i will contact chew about this 
health	we switched to this food probably 6 months ago on recommendation from our vet who also suggested adding in additional probiotic  at first our lab seemed to really like it and his stomach issues seemed to go away  oddly enough  he started getting an upset stomach again around the time the recalls came out earlier this year  just last week hill s widened the recall to include more varieties  but still they say that it does not impact dry food  when you have to widen your recall after the initial announcement  you lose all credibility with me  i am not saying that this food is no good  but i am certainly not taking any chances 
quality	i bought this food for my bullfogs trying to find an alternative to royal canine bulldog but unfortunately they did not like it      in order to avoid to waste the food i am mixing with rice and chicken but it has been a lot of work having to cook and feed them with the spoon because they really do not like it   i think i am coming back to royal canine bulldogs
quality	we used this before and our dogs loved it  we stopped for a little while and went to a competitors brand and it did not turn out well  we returned to rachael ray and when we got out order and emptied the food into the container it was so greasy it dripped out of the bag  not sure what changed but our dogs do not care for it this time 
quality	my dogs would not eat this at all  they sniffed it and walked away  i bought chicken soup for the soul dog food and they love it 
quality	i have a two year old catahoola that wolfs down everything i put in front of her  it was recommended to me to switch her food periodically  while young  to help minimize any food sensitivities  anyway  she will not touch it  i mixed in her old food and she will pick it out and leave the nutrish 
quality	my 4 dogs really don’t like this food  they turn their noses up at it 
quality	i have an 8lb poodle  when i first introduced the food i can tell he did not enjoy it  my dog usually eats everything  he will eat anything you feed him but there is something about this brand that he does not like  he is been eating about 3 4th of a cup a day for the past 3 weeks and i have noticed he is gotten quite skinny  and the food itself is kind of big for a small dog to chew 
quality	have 4 dogs  was feeding eagle pack brand dog food for about 6 months  i like to switch brand of dog food about every 6 months  two of my four dogs refused to eat the rachael ray nutrish  chicken and veggies  dry dog food  had to supplement with other food and then they would leave the  red and green  kibble in their bowl 
quality	i have seen so many commercials rachael ray does on her dog food that i assumed this would look like it does in the commercials  small brown pellets is not what she shows  very disappointing  the dogs do not care for it so it was a real big waste of money 
quality	the dogs would not eat it my senior dog and the dog sitter and myself were very concerned thinking she had stopped eating very scary
quality	this has too many calories and cody did not care for it 
quality	my doberman will not eat this food  the ingredients are good  do not get me wrong  but she just will not eat it  maybe the taste 
quality	i read good reviews on this food so thought i would give it a try    big waste of money  my dogs refuse to eat it  i am sticking with royal canin  they even pick it out if its mixed  message received and lesson learned 
health	the price for this food is excellent  my dog loved the taste  after a month of noticing her on it  she had very dry irritated skin  i thought it was from seasonal allergies  i switched her to totw and her skin has been so much better  this has both corn  filler  and grain which is not good for dogs with allergies
quality	our 2 westies will not eat this food but they will eat old roy that our son feeds his dog 
quality	i bought a small bag of small bites for my westies and they loved it  so i invested in a larger bag of the same kind only not small bites  it says for all size dogs   and they do not like it    
quality	my dogs would not eat the colored pieces and the food does not smell good 
quality	they seem to like it  but its a new food so they are not eating it as well as i thought they would  but will try it awhile longer and see if that changes
quality	i bought a small bag of this and they seemed to have like it  wellll  then i bought a 40 lb  bag and they will not eat it  i try to add a little egg or whatever i have to give it some enticement  but  no go  i will give the bag to my two granddogs  they eat anything    
quality	until it got recalled  jelly bean ate dogswell live free kibble  i switched between salmon and chicken  after the recall  jelly bean ate blue buffalo wilderness chicken or salmon  since she is chubby i thought all the veggies this would be good for her and i was sold by the commercial  she would not eat it even with a generous serving of raw instinct boost mixer topper and a few pieces of merrick power bites  she would like off the topper and eat the few power bites and spit out the nutrish 
quality	our 5 year old teddy bear will not eat it  we will keep trying to find some he will eat on a regular basis 
quality	i took in a stray  i bought the food once  my dog liked it about 3 4th of the way through the bag  then she did not want it any longer   i ended up having to add some thing tastier for her to eat it like a little nutritional yeast and water or chicken broth  i changed dog food a few times  i took in another stray  i ran out of food and i went to walmart and got this brand again  the dogs did not want to eat it  i left it out long enough they picked through most of it and got to the point they would not eat it unless i put something in it 
quality	my dogs will not eat this bag of food for some odd reason     i have fed them this exact same food purchased from a local feed store and they practically inhaled it  however this bag i purchased from chewy  they will not eat it  so weird 
product	i’ve been getting this through autoship  no issues till the last one when i found a watermelon sized chunk of food in the bag  i’m not sure why it’s stuck together or what’s in it so i had to go get my girls different food  i’ve emailed customer service and haven’t heard back which is frustrating 
quality	i do not know why  but our dog will not eat it  after 14 days  we have moved on to another food and will give away the 15 pound bag she seems to hate
quality	i bought this for my two larger breed dogs and they refuse to eat it  i have tried mixing it with other kibble and they flip the bowl and will not eat it 
health	had my dog tested and found a lot of things are still in this even though it is supposed to be for dogs with high allergies so just make sure you have your dog tested for his specific allergies 
quality	our first bag was from the vet and he did great with it  so to save money i ordered from chewy  it has been a challenge to get him to eat this bag  he turns his nose up at it and will just pick at it  so to experiment  i picked up a small bag from the vet  put it in his dish and he chowed it down  the bag from chewy had a totally different look to the kibble  it was darker in color and more oily   see photo   the cost savings from online is not worth my dog not eating it  especially if its some variance of the original  i have almost half a bag from chewy left  hopefully i can mix with the bag from the vet and not waste this expensive food 
quality	my dog really does not like this food so i have had to feed it to my other dogs who will eat anything 
quality	not that i think this is a bad product  but my doberman simply does not want to eat it  she seemed to like the samples from the vet but when we got the package  it seemed to have a different color and smell  and she immediately turned her nose when i gave it to her  does not seem to be the same product as what the vet gave her 
health	my dog has lost his appetite since using this food and seems to be very tired and less playful 
quality	i have a shepherd and a mastiff and i have been trying to find a good quality food that has no  by products  and that is not  grain free   i liked how chicken was the 1st ingredient in this kibble but my 2 savages who normally gobble up their food have zero interest in this and will either not eat it or go back and forth to finish it  guess i will have to continue my search 
health	received the “new” formula and my 2 year old lab refuses to eat  there was no indication that the formula was going to change and was not able to transition the new formula  the small amount that he finally did eat   he vomited  very disappointed on how this change was handled  fortunately i was able to find the “old” formula at a pet store and now have time to transition to another brand doubt it will be hill’s science diet
quality	the vet put my 2 dogs on this and they just do not like it  i have 3 boxers and just noticed that none of them seem to be a fan of food with chicken  may be good for someone else s pets if they like chicken  i do like the easy open and reclosable bags 
quality	wolf would not touch it and refuse to eat it after the first bite 
product	this is the 3rd time that i’ve gotten this dog food   the bag was opened  the food was all over the box  in the cat food box  and a film over the other packages 
health	my dogs had diarrhea for a week  i went back to their old food 
quality	i raised two other dogs on this food  but this one will not touch it  should have never ordered a large bag
health	look at the ingredient list in this food  the first 5 ingredient should never be in any dog s food at all  corn  wheat   soy  animal fat  by products  chicken flavor  science diet has all of these  not only is it unhealthy  but my dog hates it  he only eats it when he is starving  and when he does eat it  he barely finishes half of the bowl  do not ever buy this  even if vets recommend it  they only do it for money  because it is just junk for your dog 
quality	i thought this dog food would replace the pure balance dog food that i had been buying from walmart  zira would not touch it  i do not know why  she is a kelpie mix  60 pounds  and usually will eat anything  but after a stomach upset following jerky treats  she is pickier  i will have to look for more human grade ingredients  i suppose 
product	i appreciate chewy having these small trail sample dog food bags  it makes it easier to find a food my dog will eat right away instead of guard for hours while my diabetic cat sneaks a piece or two when i am not looking   my medium sized dog has been really picky these last couple months with dry foods and having to buy big bags of different brands  that ended up not being liked  was adding up so these small sizes really are great  not really sure why i did not notice these smaller sample sizes on here before though  i guess because i was looking at high quality dry foods that do not offer cheaper small trail bags i suppose but  this time around i am about fed up with our dog and decided not to
product	i was a little disappointed in that the size of the pieces are smaller than what i would been purchasing from the local grocery store  my dog does not seem to car though  i would recommend chewy to describe the size of the meal in order to prevent any mistakes like mine 
quality	my dogs have been on strike for three days  they absolutely refuse to eat this food  i caved in and went to the store to buy kibble   bits     a waste of money  now stuck with a huge non sealing bag of expensive dog food 
product	i was disappointed in size bag for amount money spent you could get bigger size less money many stores you need copare shop on this on
product	delivery was super fast and free  it was a great value when i used the coupon i received in the mail 
quality	i thought my food would come in a bag like i buy in the store but instead comes in a box  i don’t like it that way other than that very good service  but don’t know if i will keep the re order as the box is too hard for us to handle 
health	my dogs loved this dog food  they gobbled it up no problem  they had loose stools during the time they were on this dog food  i will go back to purina one and stick with that product  they love it and no loose stools  i cannot say that i would not recommend this to other dog owners  maybe others will have better luck with this food 
quality	i have very picky eaters  iams is another brand they do not like  i have some samples of victor that they seem to like  i will get a small bag to see how they do with it  my daughters dog loves the iams 
quality	chewy is a great company  super fast delivery and will definitely use them again  as for the food they changed it and my great dane puppy does not care for it  all the nibbles are the same size 
quality	i usually buy the same formula  but not healthy diet  vet said they needed to go on a diet  so i switched to measuring food  they ate twice as much        so  i purchased this  they would not eat it until they were hungry enough  still doubled their intake with measured meals  i switched them back to their normal food and feeding   1 gets green beans too  they are happy now
health	my dog is having problems with a yeast infection in his ears  the vet said  it could be his food  so he put him on ear drops and i am trying blue buffalo to see if it clears up  he also received a allergy shot  so far they are getting better  the blue buffalo sits in his dish all day  if i wait him out he will eat it  when i first put it out he will smell it and go lay down    trying to find something he will eat when i first put it out in the morning to get him on a schedule  eat  bathroom  then nap 
quality	my alaskan malamute did not want to eat this food even though it is supposed to be the best on the market  come to find out it has as much fillers as the cheaper food   he just does not care for it  i will change to something that is better for him with less fillers 
quality	my dog would not eat this stuff   even tried skipping 2 days and he still would not touch it  he would rather starve 
quality	daisy my seven year old lab does not like it so i added something to make her eat it she is been up chucking bile for the past three or four days no i am not giving it to her anymore ever
quality	dog did not care for this food he is almost 2 and always had puppy chow  refused to eat this for 2 days went back to puppy chow
quality	unfortunately  my dogs are not fond of it  had to invest in another brand that is more to their liking 
product	i usually buy the more expensive brands of dogfood  but i have had no income for many months except for tax refunds  so i bought this less expensive brand  my dogs were not crazy about it but would eventually eat it  this is the only food that has ever caused them to have gas  and they had it until the bag was gone  no major problem and it even gave me a couple laughs seeing their surprised reactions to the outcome from the gas  
product	i have a 3 year old male australian cattle dog  at first he did not like the food but because he is not a picky eater he ate it anyway  he gained 10 lbs on this food even though his activities remained the same  very difficult to find the right dog food these days so i opted to feeding him fresh food  yes  it is more expensive but worth every penny because it is good for their overall health  i would not recommend american journey 
quality	i do not recommend this food  my two pit bulls always seem to chow down excitedly refused to eat the 2 different journey bags of food that i purchased  i have mixed this food with purina dog food to try to get rid of it  will not buy again
quality	all the aj brand i got was on bogo   seemed healthy  but i am out over  200  bought a ton   refuses to touch it no matter what i did to help  he eats other brands so why not this  hard to rate not knowing if it tastes raunchy or dog just does not like that 1 brand 
product	good food  good price  but the packaging is tearible  purposely misspelled   if you pull the “open here” tab it rips the entire bag open and spills all over  really made a mess  and is wasteful 
health	my dog has a grain allergy  she never has access to any other food except her food  i read reviews and thought i could trust it  i thought i cancelled the auto ship but they still sent food my dog couldn’t eat and charged me 
health	my pups didn’t like this food  i bought 2 bags bogo free  i thought it was a great deal but my dogs when they heard me serving their food  they just walked away  i gave them salmon flavor first then the chicken days later but didn’t like any of them  i was so disappointed and sad i thought they were getting sick or something but no    they didn’t like this brand of food  i ended up giving it away 
quality	i was excited to order a grain free dog food  but after leaving it in his bowl all day  he would not eat it  he does eat other dry food when we visit family 
health	both my bulldogs wont eat this  they just look at it  smells bad too  going to have to switch back to nutro  its getting annoying finding a good kibble for them without any health issues  may use the grain free and mix some regular wet food in it from now on 
quality	my baby will not eat this food  bought two flavors and she will not eat either one 
quality	not sure why but my two big dogs do not like this food at all 
quality	this seemed like a grain free premium product  after the first bag though  my dog would not eat it anymore  a couple sniffs and walk away  i have even tried feeding to her by hand but she just spits out the kibbles  chewy customer service insisted they had not changed their formula and they were dependably great about replacing it just in case it was a one off batch issue  but to no avail 
quality	my dog does not eat this food with the same vigor as his previus brand with similar ingredients  for the bogo it was worth the try 
health	i have a hard time keeping weight on my puppy  he is not very good motivated  and i have never experimented with his food much  after our recent move he lost weight due to the stress but was gaining it back pretty well  i ran out and had bought a few bags of this while it was on sale  he instantly went back to losing weight  despite me splitting his meals into twice a day and giving him two more cups of kibble per day  this food does not work for my dutch shepherd  i will be going back to his old food 
quality	purina one for my babies  that is what they like  my boy do not like this food 
product	still transitioning with my 5 mo old gsds old food  and he eats the other and spits this out  i mix some raw in and he still does it  alot of money spent for no reason  i was using farmina but chewy is way too expensive so i wont purchase it from them  very disappointed  chewy wont respond to my questions regarding farmina 
product	i tried transitioning my dog to this food  but it gave him an instant upset stomach with soft yucky stool  so disappointed  as a friend of mine loves this brand  but it definitely did not sit well with my dog 
quality	i know this is good for her and she loves apples minus the pits  but she is really not eating this like i thought she would  i will keep offering it to her as i know it is good for her 
quality	i had high hopes but neither of my dogs will eat this  i have a 1 year old husky and an 11 year old australian shep  they simply do not like it 
quality	my german shepard  just will not eat    or my blue tick coon hound  so the dog food go s to waste   
quality	3 dogs and they do not like it    i get other amer journey they love
product	my dogs really like this product  sadly  i was under the impression that i was getting a buy one get one deal  overall  it seemed a bit pricey otherwise
quality	it is a good healthy brand  but my dogs turn their noses up to it and will only eat it when mixed with a can 
quality	i received a free bag of this food with my regular order  i put the dry food in my dogs feeder along with his regular dry food  he ate around the new food and now that his regular food is gone he is not eating any of the dry food  i supplement his diet with canned food 
quality	all my friends highly recommended this food  my dog has been itching and i was trying to go to grain free  unfortunatly my dog did not care for this food  he wouldnt eat it  i donated it so it wouldnt go to waste   although iv heard nothing but good about this food  maybe my dog is just picky    
health	i have 6 out of 8 dogs i was going to feed this to and none of them will eat it  very disappointing  the other 2 dogs have allergies and could not even let them try it  had to throw away the bag 
health	my dogs loved it at first  but then their poop changed from solid stools to loose messes  unfortunately  it caused one of my dogs to have explosive diarrhea and that was a nightmare 
health	we have been searching all year for the perfect food for our sensitive lab  our vet recommended this for our girl  she loves to eat and looks forward to every meal  she does have a weird skin condition going on right now but i am thinking it is probably an allergy  we are thinking about changing to the lamb purina one 
quality	at first khloe would not touch i then went and bought some beef gravy canned food since she has slowly started eating not sure if will change but if not i’ll have to find another brand
quality	i bought the large bag of this food so i could gradually introduce it to my 3 dogs by mixing it with their old food until they adjust to it  the first day they refused to eat it at all  on the second day they began to pick at it and that is the way it is been going since then  they never finish their bowls of food now  i switched from pro plan which started adding pro biotics to all their food and the prices went up by about  8 00 per bag  i would suggest to other people to buy a small bag of this food to see if their dogs like it first  my dogs are still picking out the pro plan from their bowls first before eating this one  i also bought the purina one chicken and rice but have not tried that
quality	when we first started ordering this dog food  we were impressed with the ratio of meat morsels to grain  our german shephards loved the food  unfortunately  this has changed  the food is now 90 95  grain  our dogs are not eating the product  will have to find a new dog food 
quality	i usually buy the chicken and rice flavor  3 of my 4 dogs did not care for the turkey and venison flavor and would barely eat until they were very hungry 
quality	after my purchase i decided to look up the ingredients and found that they just are not good for my dog  which i guess is why he wont eat it  he will go without eating if all i give him is this food  it is the only food he refuses to eat so far 
product	my dog did not like kibbles and bits   i will have to find another brand that is reasonable priced   but my complaint is they package it to heavy
product	i definitely will not buy this product again  very unhappy with my choice 
quality	my dog would not eat it  he is used to purina or pedigree and i thought i would have him try something different  i should not have bought 50lbs for a first trial  wish i had my money back or a replacement product 
quality	my pup will not eat this food and he eats anything  with encouragement he will eat the canned version but does not like that either 
quality	i had high hopes for this dry dog food but my dog had another idea  my yorkie has a super sensitive tummy and is a very picky eater  i thought he was enjoying the dry dog food because he would gobble the sprinkle  about a tablespoon worth  that was added to his rice   chicken for breakfast and dinner  then on day 7 he refused to eat his breakfast and dinner until the dry dog food was removed from the rice   chicken mixture  i even tried putting a few pieces of the dry kibble on his mat but it just sat there until i threw it out  unfortunately  this dry kibble did not woo my fur baby s taste buds 
quality	i have a shih tzu that had an episode of acute pancreatitis a couple of months ago  we had been feeding her royal canin urinary so  but immediately switched her to this to lower her lipid levels which had been high for awhile prior to her pancreatitis  after two months of being on this food with nothing else  except for 1 2 cans total of the canned version of this food   there was no improvement  not only that  but my dog tires of this food easily and sometimes refuses to eat it and lets our other dog eat it  this product is ineffective for my dog  not appetizing for her  and does not seem to have the greatest ingredients  either  so it is a pretty lousy food  i gave it two stars only because
quality	all 3 of my dogs turn their nose up at this  they will leave it in the bowl and skip meals  i have tried to add egg  pumpkin or yogurt and mix it to get them to eat  they will not eat the kibble even with goodies mixed in  i really wanted to like this food   great quality decent price but it’s a waste of money when it won’t be eaten at all
quality	throughout my 6 1 2 year old chocolate lab s life he loved to eat and he woofed every bite of whatever i gave him every morning and every evening except nutro  i switched up his food a few times throughout his life for variety and my vet said that he does not need variety but stability but i wanted to give him a definite upgrade of food instead of what i had been buying at the grocery store and my vet agreed with that  i figured he is 6 1 2 and i want to do whatever i can to keep him healthy and live as long as possible  he ate proplan for the 1st couple of years and then i got cheap and gave him grocery store food  i am very shocked that he is not eating the nutro with any regularity  now
quality	i have fed nutros natural choice for years and now with the new ingredients my shepherds are not eating it and losing weight  between my new dogs and my old ones we have been feeding this for over 18 years and now we are going to have to change brands  gave all the food away to my neighbor 
quality	my dog would not eat  go near  look or smell it  i thought it was great good ingredients and reviews  well he is the boss 
quality	i had thought changing my scotties food would please him but i mixed it with his other food to change gradually and he refused to eat  finally just offered the american journey and he would not eat it  read all the reviews and had hopes but not so  back to his old food and he is eating fine 
quality	when i put this food in my belgian shepherd belgian malinois  bowl  he walked away every time  the only way to get him to eat it was by mixing it with the bag of chicken   sweet potato  he would have rather gone hungry than eat the beef   sweet potato  it smelled like regular beef dog food  but he has an acute sense of smell    this food he did not like 
quality	my dogs are not picky at all  but they would not eat this  i know not to get this brand again 
quality	my boston terrier will literally eat any foods  i bought this   another flavor on a buy one  get one free offer  i have done the slow mix of old new food  i do not think this has what she needs  judging by her coat   indifference to the food  so now i have like 50 lbs of food for a 20 lb pup  that she does not like  i have not opened the other bag  not sure what to do with it
quality	i thought i would try this since it was buy one get one free for my 6 month old siberian husky shiba inu puppy  he turns his nose up to it i was hoping he would like it  i wanted a grain free high protein dry food for him and this is not it  he will go all day without eating it and then will pick at it   so now i have an opened bag and a full unopened bag  i have 2 other dogs but they are older and it is too high protein for them i gave it 2 stars because it being a special offer and the bag is very strong i guess he is just being picky 
quality	went three days of not eating   i opened a different brand and she ate  loves the nutro ultra  purina beyond superfood blend  and other american journey    as long as they are not beef  not sure why  because table scraps beef is great  so only salmon and lamb based meats with egg  pumpkin  sweet pototoes  peas  and such 
product	although they love the wet american journey food they’re not crazy about this  they’ll nibble on it here and there but not really impressed  i may try other flavors just to see if i can change their minds  overall between the cat and dog foods i will say american journey is a top notch product and i feel great giving it to my pets
health	my dogs ate this without issue for the past 4 months  my staffie mix  her skin allergies have not been an issue at all since starting this food  which has been great  however  she has stopped eating the food  my maltese will not eat it anymore and has started eating the puppies food that is another brand  we had the puppy on the puppy version of this brand  but she has loose stools so we tried another brand  the yorkie  well he eats anything so it is great for him  nutrionally it is a great food for my dogs  unfortunately  i need food the dogs will eat 
quality	did not agree with my frenchie  does not soften very well in water
quality	i ordered this food because it is high quality  my picky husky would not touch this food at all  and my beagle who eats anything turned his nose up at this  my beagle ended up eating it  but reluctantly  unfortunately  i will not order this food again because of that 
product	not really sure how many stars to put cause i bought  2   24lbs bags both different flavors of this dog food  my dog wouldnt even touch it  not sure why cause she usually is not picky  i ended up donating all of it 
quality	while this product seems good and i have no real issue with it  our dog does not like it  we put it down for her for one week straight and she would barely nibble on it  we have since switched to a blue buffalo product that she prefers  it is a shame because i was really hoping she would like this one 
quality	i thought this would work  i can get him to eat a few pieces from my hand  but will not eat more than 10 pieces  i will give the rest away 
product	this food is ok  but not worth the      the only reason my canines enjoyed it at first was because it was new  once they got used to it the novelty wore off 
quality	my dogs liked this food  i liked the price  i do recall my boxers scratching a bit more than usual  still working on finding the right food for both of my dogs  this is a good product to buy when on a budget 
quality	if you have a large dog they may like this kibble  but my 4 small dogs did not care for it  i do not know if it was the size of the kibble or the taste but either way i am stuck with the huge bag of dog food that my dogs will not eat 
quality	this is the only dry food that my dog refuses to eat  usually he views a new brand of kibble as a treat  i am trying to mix it with other brands just to use up the food 
quality	i wanted to like this food  very reasonable price  good reviews  grain free  our two senior dogs will not touch it at all  not one bite  not one taste  they are not picky either  this food just was not for them  i paid pretty much half price for the first bag so at least i am not out of a lot of money  just really bummed the dogs would not eat it  my husband was out of work due to weather for awhile so we were not able to continue feeding them as good of a diet as they were used to  which is why i wanted to try this  it looked to be a good quality and it is affordable 
quality	not sure why but my two labs would not eat this brand  usually give them blue and taste of the wild  ingredients sound good but my dogs rated  no  
product	well got my bag today and saw that not all the median sat from the usa to outsource   that being said i will not buy this food again    i need to know where it is coming from and what plant is making it  from my research chewy is not giving out that info 
health	this food gave my dog very loose stool  not fun to clean up 
product	my 12 year old rescue things this dry food is very tasty and would rate it almost 5  however  owner finds the packaging poor unless you pay the extra for a small bag  on the 22 lb  i bought there is no zip seal or other way to close it to stay fresh  only way is to fold down and use tape    a bother hence the 3 rating  i recommend if you do not mind sealing it yourself 
quality	unfortunately my dogs will not eat this anymore i do not know if it was a bad bag of food but my border collie and my keplie take all day nibble at it  personally i think we just got a bad batch unfortunately
product	i have trusted blue buffalo for a lot of years  i have fed my two dogs and two cats this food because i felt it was the best  recently i have heard of all the lead in this food  so disappointed  i have switched to origen and acana and can already tell such a difference in my dogs especially  sorry  blue  lost my trust forever 
product	i love blue however my dogs did not seem to like this kind   that is the only con with buying expensive food   you risk your dog not liking the flavor 
quality	i bought your product in hopes my little maltese mix would eat it as it has meat as the first ingredient  she turns her nose up at it  will not eat it so i have to resort to giving her cesar wet food  i was quite disappointed  i had high hopes for blue  i could not say i recommend this product as my dog will not eat it 
health	this is supposed to be a really good food  and it may be  but i have been unable to switch my dog from his current food to blue buffalo  every time i substitute some of bb for his regular food  he gets diarrhea  i will look for another lamb and rice to give him 
quality	i do not like this dog food i tried it and it was making my dogs loss there fur and really itchy and i never had that problem with other dog foods
health	the food stinks so bad  dogs like it but to me it smells like vomit so i will buy the natural and see if that smells better 
quality	i was looking for a more natural product that did not have a heft price to go along with it  the price you pay for the amount of dog food is a great value  my dog did not like the taste at all   refuses to eat it 
product	great product but chewy s price is outrageously overpriced   i can go to any walmart or sam s club and get a 55 lb page for  19 99 
quality	ordered these treats to go with my rex diets for little ralphie   who has serious gut issues from long term chemo and steroids  ralphie is 5lbs and no longer has all his teeth  i knew the treats were not soft but thought i could break these up for him  sadly the smell of   brewers yeast  was overpowering on these rock hard  boulder size  treats  thanks chewy for allowing me a refund on these    still getting over the sticker shock of a huge rex diet purchase and these were the part that does not work  they might work for larger dogs with powerful jaws    who like a yeast flavor though 
health	our dog recently started having some gastro issue in december and we are still learning more and looking for solutions as to what exactly is causing his issues   constant loose stool  occasional vomiting  gas  loud gurgling or borborygmi  grass eating  loss of appetite etc   everything was upsetting his stomach  so we gave these a try  they seem fine at first  and then a couple weeks of having these they upset him stomach  and he was having an upset stomach  gas  loss of appetite  sad because he loved them  its been a couple months since then and we now believe that he either has ibs or server food allergies  even though these are for dogs with food sensitivities  it did not quite agree with him
product	my dog opie who has hge loved these until they  changed the packaging   i could break them for him  i have an old bag and the ingredients have changed and now they require a hammer to break and opie is no longer enamored with them  extremely disappointed as he is very limited 
health	we have a shitzu and he has terrible skin issues  diagnosed allergic to pine and cockroaches  he can never have a treat other than peanut butter  we got these because the vet also has them for their  patients   although after a month of giving him them he has broke out and cannot eat them anymore  even if they are hypoallergenic which stinks  i still recommend them if your dogs are not allergy prone 
quality	order this treat because my dog need need eat low fat things  but he does not like it at all  not sure why 
health	i am sure that this treat is compatible with many dogs  diets  however  my dog was severely allergic to them  he eats hills z d diet  but these treats resulted in ear infections  rash  and excessive itching  i do not think that the claims re  product being hypoallergenic are accurate for all pets 
product	purchased the wicker dogcrate xl put together easy was plenty big enough for my 88 lb ger  shepherd  but one problem she chewed the side of the crate and got out and destroyed the camper door was amazed she got out the little area top side of the side of it three times got out even with paddlelocks on top and bottom of the crate will never buy another             
health	these were close to the same ingredients in the vet prescription diet of royal canin that my dog eats  however  the hill s version gave her severe diarrhea  as a result  she cannot have them  i cannot recommend for my dog  but may be ok for others  she did like the taste of them  as a note  my dog has a super sensitive stomach  and as she is aged  she has also developed a few food allergies  she used to be able to eat plain boiled chicken  but can no longer have it 
quality	we have 3 great danes and a german shepherd  they would not touch this food  we even tried putting chicken broth on it     definite no go in this house 
quality	well seems bulldogs do not like this food to much  i have been feeding for 2 weeks  and between 2 bulldogs they have not ate 5 pounds of it 
quality	my dog would not eat this food no matter what i put in it he would just walk away   i am not saying its bad food just that my dog is picky and would not eat it
quality	looks like a great food but looks are deceiving  my dogs turned up their noses and would not eat it  i gave some to a friend and he gave it to his dog and it threw it up both times 
quality	we are constantly on the lookout for an organic  non gmo  minimal ingredient  quality dry food for our 140 pound great pyrenees  i was excited about the price point for this dry food and bought 2 bags with convenient free shipping from chewy  unfortunately  he does not like it  we have to add real chicken  organic  free range that we raise ourselves  or venison to get him to eat it   adding significantly to the time and cost  will need to return the unopened  second bag  disappointing    
quality	i was hoping to find a healthy food for my 2 german shepherd mix rescues  that did not cost an arm and leg  was so hoping this was it  both dogs are refusing to eat it  they would rather eat the other food i tried before this one   that they would pick out certain kibbles  while leaving other s all over the floor  i have yet to find a food  they both love and will eat   unless it is filled with filler s   by products  gmo d corn and soy  and other stuff  why is so hard to find a healthy  yet tasty dog food 
quality	it is no high priced super dog food  it is food and they ate it  i have a puppy pit bull and an adult labrador  both seemed to enjoy it and had no adverse reactions  it is not my preferred brand and i will probable only by it if i cannot afford my normal food  i know there are many who do not like the ethics of the company and my review is on the dog food not the company  do what makes you feel comfortable and what you feel you can afford 
product	they seem to like the food ok  but after reading about this rescue and all the accusations i probably will not buy again  it is over priced anyway  think i can do better 
quality	for some reason my dogs refuse to eat this dog food 
health	corn is one of the main ingredients in this food  american veterinary association corn is the worst ingredient that is added to dog food as a filler creating long term health problems  i will be returning this and never ordering again
quality	the pellets are rock hard  she makes a mess  because she cannot chew it easily 
product	purchased for my 3 dogs    none of them will touch it  i have tried for 3 days offering it to them several times a day and they smell it and walk away  a huge waste of money on a 40 pound bag of food 
quality	it seemed like my 5 dogs were bored with their purina dry food so i changed but they do not like the nutrish as much  they love the nutrish wet food  i have had to buy some more purina dry food to mix with this so they will eat it 
quality	our pugs refused to eat this food  they do not like it  nutrish has no pieces of carrots or peas or meat in it  the food is just blocks of unpleasant smelling dry food 
quality	my dogs do not like this food  switching back to blue
quality	my dog is not normally a picky eater but  he sniffed this and looked at me like i was out of my mind  had to doctor up by using toppers  gravy  buy meat and bake it unseasoned to mix with the dog food before he would attempt to eat it  but he would eat the toppers and meat and some of the dog food which had more gravy on it and spit the rest of it out on the floor to make a big mess for me to cleanup  am trying to make better choices for his food but  if he will not eat it  what can i do  i love him too much to let him starve    at my wits end 
quality	my dog georgie has been eating flint river since birth  recently they went out of business  she is not to fond of her new food  she is not eating it  she will have to get used to it but if you have any suggestions we would welcome them  thanks so much 
quality	so after doing so many different foods  research after research  i decided to give this food a try  i have two dogs  one 7 months old and one 2 months old  the first one was always itching  runny frequent poops  hair not the greatest  and dry skin  now i will say his coat isn’t as brittle  but he still poops a lot and it’s kind of too solid  almost like he had a hard time going  the puppy is also the same  so i’m not sure if it’s something in the food or what  but with the puppy also being the same makes me think that  the puppy clears his bowl but my older one picks throughout the day  so i think i’m still on the hunt for a good food that meets all our requirements  this food isn’t for us  i
quality	my 3 great danes will not eat this formula  so i am switching back to victor professional 
quality	i cannot understand why there are so many positive reviews  i ordered a 40 lb bag and now i am stuck with it  my dogs will not eat it  i have tried wetting it  adding bouillon  and they will not touch it  what a complete waste of money   
quality	when i ordered this kibble i asked about the size of the kibble but that person did not know  it came but the pellets were too small and abby will not eat it  if the kibble is not the size of m   m s  she will not eat them  i am sure the food is good as it is rated very high  but if they only made their size larger they would have a hit here at our home 
quality	my dogs loved this at first and now refuse to eat it  i understand they changed the formula  dogs already knew 
health	i am not saying this is not a premium and good dog food  however  my 194lb irish wolfhound  gryphon will not eat it  even with just a small amount mixed in to transition him over  once he discovers it is in his bowl  he walks away  he does have a sensitive stomach and mushy poo so i tried victor  but if he will not eat it  well   
product	recently i contacted chewy to inform them that my dogs were no longer interested in eating the chicken meal flavor after the ingredient change  they were happy to give me a refund and i order a bag of the hi pro plus  my dogs have no issue eating this flavor  but then i noticed that a lot of the kibble in the bag had small hairs sticking out of each piece  i am grossed out  i understand that this is most likely from the animals that are used in making the food  but this is not the “super premium quality” that i would expect  it’s hard to tell from the picture but the kibble is consumed with tiny black and blonde hairs  when i poured it out on a paper plate two hairs landed on the plate not even
health	had been using for 18months for my pup but now i will be switching to a new brand  victor should have just raised prices or reduced size but not changed formula if it was a financial decision  anyway they have lost my business  just a few newer additions to the formula that i do not like include  blood meal  really that must be the reason the protein percentage went up  its by product of the slaughter house  powered cellulose  is plant or wood fibers aka cheap food binder which is indigestible  vegetable oil  composed of cheap corn and soybean excess efas can exacerbate arthritis  hip   joint conditions and may cause other medical conditions 
health	just switched my puppy to this brand of food  and she is had nothing but diarrhea since we started  really upset about it cause we bought a 40lb bag of food and now we have to find something else  thought this was gonna be the food we stick to forever after all good reviews but i guess not  i am sure it works for some dogs but not this one 
product	still disappointed  i tried several formulas victor had to offer for my dogs  i wanted them to work so bad since this food comes so highly recommended from so many   after looking into it more and speaking with others who feed it  a lot say they had similar issues because the food is rich so they mixed it with other brands  maybe worth a try  i like feeding variety 
quality	no matter how badly you want your dogs to eat a quality food  if they refused to eat it it does not do them any good  both of my young border collie s have refused to eat every victor i have gotten them  over the past year i have tried different varieties of victor and ended up adding stuff to it to make them eat it  not cost effective 
health	this food came highly recommended  my puppy had loose stool while i transitioned the diet change  i had to stop this product due to its continued effect 
quality	i really wanted this food to work out  chewy com offers a great service and i have been so happy since i started shopping here  their customer service is beyond great and has been helpful the couple of times i needed assistance  because of that  i wanted to use their brand in a way to  pay them back  for the extra mile they have gone  unfortunately  my lab  who really does usually eat everything i give her  will not eat it  she goes for a few meals before she eats it while throwing daggers at me with her very expressive eyes  i even tried using a different protein  but that did not work either  i finally broke down and sprinkle some parmesan cheese on it before she will eat it  very disappointed
health	i tried this because one of my dogs has a food allergy and food with salmon was recommended  unfortunately none of my dogs would eat this food 
product	i do not know it just seems my dog do not really like it
quality	it seems like it is taking our dog 120lbs  forever to eat this food  he will not eat it unless we add something irresistible to it otherwise it has good ingredients and seems to be a good dog food 
quality	same as my cats my dog would not touch it donated it as well 
product	chose this due to the massive amount of stars  my 2 year female siberian husky ate only about 3 cups reluctantly but now stays mostly uneaten for 2 weeks now  originally came from taste of the wild but my dog seemed to be getting bored of that too so do not buy a large bag unless you are sure it will be eaten 
quality	my dogs will not touch it  the smell is very strong  i ended up donating it to a local pet shelter  the price is too high for a pet food that smells so strong that even made me not eat my dinner 
health	this food is amazing my dogs love it and devour it  however if your dog has a sensitive stomach i would not recommend this food  i have to mix this food in half with another dog food so that he can eat it  i believe it is just the salmon in it  the other american journey foods are amazing as well  will still always buy this brand 
product	the value was good but my dogs do not really like it all that much  i will not buy it again 
quality	my dog refuses to eat this  please cancel future shipments of this product 
quality	this new dog food was on special on black friday so i thought i would have my dogs try it  the ingredients are great but the kibble is extremely hard  my lab hound mix who will eat almost anything has a tough time unless i let it soak in a little water for 10 minutes  my dogs are 9 years old and their teeth are more sensitive but my dog has not had this issue with other brands  my medium sized beagle mix cannot eat it and he tried several times  i have got him now eating canned food since he just had some teeth removed 
quality	i purchased this along with the chicken flavored one  i decided to try it again after my last bag  because it was on sale for a really great price  both bags have the same smell and seem tasteless  my dogs do not like it very much  but they eat it  it took 4 days to get it  even though it said 1  2 day shipping  then it was delivered to my neighbor s house 
quality	our dog ate this food the first couple days  now turns her nose up to it  still will eat it but sits in the bowl for quite awhile before she takes a bite 
product	this food appears to be relatively nutritious and tasty  but blue buffalo is one of the brands that has been implicated in the diet related dilated cardiomyopathy cases  furthermore  the fda recently released another report that suggests pea protein is one of the main correlations among the diet associated cases  and peas are very high up on this ingredient list  third ingredient  in fact  right in front of ingredient  4  pea protein   for me  that is not worth the risk  that said  my dogs enjoyed this food  and it did not make their breath smell fishy like some salmon based foods do 
quality	my dogs have been on this food for years but they would not eat this bag  after comparing the food to the batch we had before of the exact same kind it is noticeably different  lighter in color and the kibbles appear to be slightly larger  i do not know if this bag is a bad batch but i am going throw it out because my dogs will not eat it 
product	package came on time  however when i opened the box and took out the dog food  the food spilled all over the kitchen floor because the bag was already open 
quality	my dogs loved natures recipe pure essentials salmon flavor and it has been discontinued   they are big fruit and veggie eaters   tried blue buffalo salmon and they are not fond of it   will keep trying to find a food they like  
quality	my puppy stopped eating when we started giving him blue buffalo  even the treats he will not eat them  i have a whole bag left  i am switching to a different brand since he did not like this brand 
quality	i like the ingredients and the protein fat ratio  unfortunately  the best food will not help the dog if it refuses to eat it  three of my four dogs turned their noses at this flavor  i am glad i bought a small bag 
health	my fox terrier developed a skin allergy from all of the people food and dog treats she was eating  her skin was oily and not only was she scratching all of the time  but she had a horrible body odor  after going to another veterinarian about her condition  we put her on this food and removed all of the treats  she is been on this food for about three years and the itching and i believe the body odor is gone  not sure about the oily skin because we bathe her a couple times a week for peeing on herself in bed  she appears to like her food  we add water to it so that she does not choke  we store it in it is bag with the top cut off and inside a plastic container  it seems to keep it is quality  i hope
product	i tried this after having had a horrible time with nature s instinct boost raw kibble  the ingredients if you read them are top notch and i do recommend this product but it just did not work for my boys  immediately after we started feeding it they started to scratch and knaw at their paws  my puppy finn completely took the fur off of one paw getting at himself my other dogs are missing patches of fur in different locations  i guess it must be the fish  not for everyone eh  disappointed cause the ingredients are fantastic but just rubbing my boys the wrong way 
quality	my dog is not fussy but she will not eat this food  i have to mix in chicken or beef to try and trick her into eating it  this dog food smells very fishy  more like cat food  it might be healthier and grain free but if she will not eat it what is the point  i would not buy it again 
quality	he did not like the smell and did not even eat a bite  he would not eat this even when he was very hungry 
health	when doing a google search for  tapioca in pet food   i stumbled upon some  well  very interesting   more than troubling information  you can do your own homework   confirm for yourself the bottom line that tapioca  used as a whole grain substitute as it is in this product  is potentially dangerous for your precious dogs      has to do  among other things  with how hydrogen cyanide toxicity is created by regular intake of tapioca in your pet s body    how tapioca actively reduces the quality of the protein in the product   its accessibility to your pet s system  
product	tried this for the first time still trying to find a dry dog food that my dog will like  it was quite a shock when the bag was opened and the fish odor hit me  knew it was salmon but did not expect it to smell so strong  have to change the location of stored dog food away from pantry  i am sure it is a fine food but beware of the smell 
quality	my large labradoodle will not eat it at all  i was hoping he would but no 
quality	my dog did not like it  i tried it 2 days in a row and i know she was hungry  but still would not eat it   not that it is a bad dog food  it was just that my dog did not like it 
product	product is fine but the extra increase in bag size may be slightly less expensive the weight increase is not worth the savings  my wife can’t lift the bag and even i struggle with the weight and bulk
quality	have had this food for a week  arie will not eat it  back to nutro we go 
product	arrived quickly and our dog enjoyed it  however several cans arrived damaged and not sure i want to use them 
quality	this is the weirdest textured dog food i have ever bought  it is harder than normal pate dog food and sticky  it is too hard to mush it down and mix dry dog food in with it with a spoon  you have to use your hands  my dog still eats it and the consistency does not seem to be an issue  but i will be going back to the meat shred and gravy version of this food 
product	my dog had a pancreatic gastric attack and the doctor recommended this food  he is not all that crazy about the taste so i mix in a teaspoon of warm chicken broth and he gobbles it up  it is too soon to tell if the food is working for his condition or not  my issue is the packaging  i ordered a case of 12 cans and 5 of them were so badly dented that i had to throw them out  i am really disappointed that chewy would send me any severely dented cans  but 5 is excessive 
health	we have a senior dog with health issues  when she was diagnosed with her disease  this food was prescribed by her vet  she has been eating this food for several months and it has greatly improved her appetite and digestion  my only complaint is the price  it is expensive  we have a small dog  so i cannot even imagine the monthly cost if she was a bigger dog 
health	although i am not fond of ingredients that hill s uses in their foods  preferring more natural ones w no by products  the rx ones seem to really handle the specific disease an animal exhibits  also my dog likes this food and the moisture content is helpful for her organs  she also gets homemade broth to increase fluid intake  however some of the cans arrived w dents in the bottom 
health	my dog loved this food  but  it caused some digestive issues and he had to switch back to grain free  while we used this food though  he ate every bit of the food  would recommend if your dog can tolerate grains 
product	i have two large dogs and just cannot afford the grain free expensive food and this seems to be the next best thing
quality	i have no idea what is going on with this food but i can’t get my dog to eat it  he’s not a picky eater  but turns his nose up at this food  tried drizzling bacon grease and put bits of bacon in it  tried mixing with the wet  nothing   78 down the drain
product	just does not seem like my dogs like very well  it is first time they been introduced to this brand  maybe it will improve  chewy service great  right on time even with adjustment of delivery schedule 
health	chewy is great  this dog food has corn in it  which if i had known i would never have ordered  even though the vet said to use it i cannot harm my dog with corn and will find something else 
quality	my yorkie will not touch the so urinary blend prescription food  i tried moistening it with warm water  chicken broth      nothing worked  my shitzu will eat it but the yorkie with urinary issues will not take one bite 
quality	food looks and smells great but my poodle will not eat  since she had reactions to blue buffalo she will not eat anything    
product	ingredients and price are a win for this product  unfortunately  my dog does not really like these  i do not give her wet food often  it is more of a treat thing  and i always mix it in with her dry food  when i add this  she just looks at her bowl for several minutes  she will eat it eventually  but there is no enthusiasm  i will just stick to coconut oil  keep it simple 
quality	my gsd does not like it much for some reason  just sniffed it and walked away  had to mix it with alpo for the dog to eat it
quality	cans came dented   i do not like it so much    my mom will not order this brand again   i air bury it before i eat only a few bites   
quality	i ordered this for my momma dog she would not eat it
product	it looks really good and i thought our dog would love it after we opened it and checked it out but he won’t eat it at all and this is not a picky dog we had to mix it with his old dog food to hide it and get him to eat it i called chewy and told them how disappointed i was and they did refund my money and i will be taking the rest of the cans to donate to an animal shelter 
quality	typical cheap sub par dog food  it looks fake and my dog would not eat it  i’m not even sure if it is real food   
quality	my dog refuses to eat any of this     she hates it       don t know why         
quality	how do i get a refund  both of my dogs refuse to eat this dog food  i have never seen them turn down any dog food flat before  this is a first  i guess that is why it was on sale  what is the process for a return 
quality	my three dogs did not care for this food  two ate it without enthusiasm and the third would not eat it at all 
quality	not only will our dog s not eat any of the flavors from here  we have had multiple cans that when we have opened them the food is bad right out of the can 
quality	but i do not like the smell  so i cannot say it is bad since they eat it it s just me
quality	my dog hates this food  my dog will eat any wet food  but he will not touch this stuff  i thought it was a good deal but since he wont eat it  i guess it was not a good deal 
quality	my dog will not eat this  either kind  and she will eat anything 
product	my dogs liked the food just fine  however  we got two of the 12 can packs and probably 75  of the cans in both packs were between 50 75  full  not containing 12 net oz of food gravy total  i even started weighing them when i opened them because it was starting to get ridiculous  no idea what happened but that’s not cool 
quality	this is the first time i have had a negative experience and i hope the last  both cases of this food must have been dropped from considerable height to be so dented  the shrink wrap was torn and i had to throw away one can  the shipping box was perfectly intact so it was not the delivery carrier  very disappointing  no wonder the cases were bogo free 
product	really good stuff  dogs love them  great at bogo  too expensive at 20  a case 
quality	my dogs did not care for this food  had never heard of it  but bought it because it was bogo 
quality	for the most part  the food looks hearty and the ingredients are great  however  my dogs will not eat the vegetables  i am not sure vegetables would be part of a dog diet if they were in the wild 
product	the food appears to be a little dry for moist  needs more sauce gravy  but the most disappointing  not all cans would open  as you try to open the lid  it would collapse and jam  hence  three cans not useable  i will not reorder this american journey food 
quality	i bought these because they were two for one  they are like a stew not solid like the cheaper canned dog food  however  i will not buy them again  my dogs did not like them and i got them because my older dog needed softer food mixed with her hard  the idea was to motivate her to eat her food as she has not eaten like she used to  my dogs simply preferred the cheaper cans of meat flavored dog food  i will stick with those from here on out 
quality	my livestock guard dog refuses to eat it  guess she recognizes one of her flock even in a can 
quality	not even one star  i have 3 yorkies  one is picky the other two eat nearly everything  two tasted and would not eat another bite  tried beef first  chicken next  picky one ate two bites  the other two wouldn’t even try it  won’t let me send without rating so i’ll put 1 star but it does not rate even one star 
quality	my dogs did not care for this brand   the chucks of meat do not look appetizing   gave the remaining cans to a neighbor 
quality	i hate to rate this item because my lab is very finicky  she will not touch either the beef or the chicken  honestly i think it is just my labby girl  shes picky  if its not the real thing she wont touch it 
quality	i saw this dog food  read the reviews and decided to try it  big mistake  my dog will not go near it  and he is not a picky eater  now i have a case of cans that i will be donating  lesson learned  stay with the food they like  no need to change it up 
quality	the price is good  in the ingredients list looks pretty decent  but my dog does not like the chicken  he likes the beef fine  but it is very apparent he does not like the chicken  and he is not a picky eater  i will not be buying it anymore 
product	i was very disappointed to find that an almost identical item with the same ingredients is sold at my grocery store for 30 cents a can less 
quality	my dogs do not like it  they will not eat it  too bad cause the price is good 
quality	this bag of food had a weird smell upon opening it but i figured it was normal  my dogs must have not agreed with the smell either  as they would not eat it at all  it sat in their bowls for a few days before i was forced to dump it out and donate the bag to my shelter  i’ve heard wonderful things about the brand  it’s just this particular one is not for my babies 
product	i have been purchasing taste of the wild for my gsd since she was a puppy and occasionally i will switch between bags of the taste of the wild grain free formulas just to give her a change  when i was mixing in a supplement i noticed this has corn in it even though the ingredients do not list it  very disappointed with taste of the wild for false advertisement  my dog is allergic to grains and trusted what was on the ingredient list but now realize i will have to be more diligent in inspecting her food before she eats regardless of the ingredients listed 
quality	normally she gets super excited for her kibble  we cycle through the flavors so she does not get bored though she is not a year yet and she just does not really want anything to do with it  she will chew on it for a moment but if she drops it she is done with it  the only way she actually eats much of it is with a pourover  hoping it is just she does not like this one in particular 
product	we have 4 dogs  i have been buying this brand for them for a long time  the breed we have is quite complex in terms of health   brussel griffons  their health is fragile  so we are very attentive to their diet  we appreciated that  taste of the wild  company used vacuum food packaging  vacuum packaging allows food to maintain its quality for much longer  this is the first time we got their product non non vacuum packaged  in addition  every time with a new package i taste the food i give to my dogs  this time the taste is also very different compared to the one i bought before  the fat content is extremely high  there is no longer the amazing taste of roasted meat that was before  i called chewy com
quality	this seems like a good product with good reviews but my 10 month old dog just did not care for it   had to mix it with all kinds of things to get him to eat it  so it is back to the drawing board to try and find something he likes   
quality	they do not like it very much  they only eat it when they are really hungry or mixed with wet food  i do not think it is the worst food maybe just not for them  they prefer eating my labs food  i will try another flavor for them and if it does not work i will go back to they are old food 
quality	my great dane is not crazy about the flavor  but he is a picky guy  so we will stick with the totw wetlands flavor  who does not like roasted duck after all   
product	nothing more than what was agreed  i ordered a product they shipped it  nothing special nothing sacred  just an order with delivery  they did not even make the dog food i bought
product	on recommendation from my daughter  had this shipped to my granddaughter for her nephew s chihuahua rocky  about 2 yrs old  and granddaughter told me he does not really like it very much  prefers another brand of small kibble  so i guess i will not buy this again  that is why i gave it only 3 stars 
health	after finding our dog was allergic to some grains  such as rice  barley  and flax  i was happy to find this food  but we have tried two of the varieties and she just does not seem to like the taste  she leaves the food in the dish until she is very hungry  her appetite is good  as she is practically begging for her treats 
health	using for over a month as instructed no weight loss yet 
product	the box was bust open also the dog food was open everywhere a waste of money
quality	bogey  senior cocker spaniel  has never been picky about what he eats  but just does not care for this  maybe he read healthy weight on the side and got uppity 
quality	they will not eat it they just leave it in their bowls  this is the first wet food i have ever found that they will not eat 
product	i know it must be bad when my one dog who eats anything won’t eat this food  i thought blue buffalo as expensive as it is was supposed to be good   i bought two cases and not cheap i might add and i’m stuck with it other than two cans i tried feeding him so i have to rebuy my dog food and i’m not happy at all     
quality	the only complaint i have about this is when i mix frankie s dry food with this he ends up  smooshing  it all flat and he ends up not interested in it and it sits until the evening time where it has turned brown and he turns his nose up to it  i will get a gravy type next purchase and only feed half 
quality	i received approximately 75 cans of blue buffalo food normally at two dollars and   88 about 80  of the cans were dented and i am in fear of feeding them to my dog due to possible contamination
product	i bouth 48 cans 22 were dented bad shane if this is what to expect keep it
quality	3 dogs  2  dogs eat it and  1  dog licked it and walked away 
product	the headline says it all  i did not realize i was ordering such a huge bag  so i am going to donate it to our local shelter 
quality	i orginally purchased it because of the good reviews  and i was trying to purchase something that was less expensive  i originally was giving my german shepard  blue buffalo  my dog hates this  will not eat it  i will definitely need to go back to the expensive stuff 
quality	been feeding our three dogs blue buffalo for a number of years now  the last order of two bags small bred adult chicken and rice   for some reason all three dogs did not eat it  you might want to check see if bb has a problem   i have to run out to grocery store to get dog food  js
product	i ordered this for my dog  he dosent like  please stop the auto delivery
quality	the toys i purchased were awesome  but unfortunately my small dogs will not eat the blue buffalo dog food 
health	i have a very finicky shitzu who does not take well to kibble  she will eat this but i have to whet her appetite with bonito flakes
product	this is a good product but imagine my disappointment when i opened the box to find that the bag was ripped and the food had spilled into the box 
quality	maybe it is my dogs  but this  good  food they just do not like  i am trying to switch them to a healthier brand  but they would rather starve than eat it   i have even slowly mixed the brands but now that it is only the blue buffalo  they turn away until they are ravaged and have no choice 
quality	when i ordered this food i was convinced it would be great for my dog  however i find he will not eat it  i have tried and tried  right now i leave a bowl for full feed and maybe he will eat 1 3 cup in a week or more  maybe  so disappointed 
quality	first time customer purchase   bought two bags of chow  my dog does not like it  i have to mix in some moist beneful dod food to get him to eat some of it  he is really trying to just eat the beneful and leaves the dry stuff  the bags are big and not easy to handle or serve from  i would like to swap these for something my dog will eat and like 
quality	my picky girl does not like this and it gave my great dane soft poop
quality	my dog will not eat it  he just leaves it in his bowl and looks at me  the reason i gave it one star was because i had to rate it in order to send the review in 
quality	i have 32 adults dogs out of them 17 did not want to eat it  i was looking for something better to feed but to many turned their noses up
quality	i recently bought this brand and during the process of slowly adding the new food with the current food  her noses through and will not eat the new food so i am guessing he does not like it     
quality	not sure why but both my dogs are not eating this  if i put something on it then they will pick on it 
quality	after a few weeks of trying this food with my dog he began refusing to eat this food  we have never had any issues with him eating up until now  we were hoping this would be a good choice for our puppy but it seems he has grown to hate it and we will be switching him back to his old food  unfortunately i am now stuck with a good portion of this bag left and are unable to donate it due to the bag already being open 
quality	i donated the second bag i purchased to the local dog rescue  i know it is good food but if your dogs will not eat it  it does not help them 
quality	my dogs have never turned their noses to anything i’ve ever offered  i gave two full bowls of this and they sniffed it and didn’t touch it for a couple hours when they realized that was breakfast  i gave it a day and had to run to petsmart and grab a different bag of food when they wouldn’t even finish their food after being there all day 
quality	my 2 small dogs would not eat this at all they went 2 days and still didn’t touch it  they only get dry food and no table food 
product	when i opened the bag  i noticed some web like material  i looked closer and the bags was full of worms  make sure you look closely at the food in the bag before feeding it to your dogs  i called customer service and they were going to send another bag  i had them refund my money instead  i also ordered a bag of the limited ingredient diet and had no issues with it 
product	my dogs absolutely love the food  it is just a great deal of it was gone by the time i received it  the bag had large holes on both ends as if someone attempted to lift bag and ripped bag  then shipping box with two bags of 28  lbs of food was quite heavy so the box was coming apart at the bottom where most of my dog food escaped and was lost  never had a problem before this order  i am very disappointed this shipment 
quality	i purchased this dog food after much consideration and review of ingrediants in product  unfortunately for me i did not consult my 3 boxers before making purchase  they did not like this dog food and refuse to eat it  i am sticking with chewy as i appreciate the convenience of the purchase  i did however make changes to my auto ship  i purchased a small bag of dog food that they liked and will be switching brands
quality	i have 2 dogs  neither of them are picky eaters  but they do not like this food at all  i try to mix in other food with it just so they will eat it  but they pick around it and leave this in the bowl  total waste of money  i do not recommend this  and will not buy this brand again 
product	ordered 3 bags and the dogs loved it  however one of the bags was turns from the warehouse and taped up and shipped to me  this was slightly disappointing 
health	i was doing the gradual change in food and mixing together this and their other food  and all 4 of my dogs ate around this  none of them are picky  but they just do not like this food  since i have been mixing it in  they have also been throwing up a lot and i am not sure why  definitely not buying this again  i just hope they can get through this bag so it is not a waste 
quality	my dog will not eat this unless her life depends on it  she walks away when i put this in her bowl and the bowl is not empty until maybe 12 hours later where at that point she was hungry and desperate  my dog ate the chicken and sweet potato version of this brand  do not know what is wrong with this one 
quality	i purchased a bag if this and when i opened it    it smelled so awful    my dogs will not touch their food now that i put it in their dish  i do not blame them it smells like medicine in a bag   not a pleasing scent for a meal  
product	the food is a prescription diet for my cocker mix  knew what i was getting  slightly disappointed by the number of dented cans  unfortunate  but i love chewy 
health	first  i would like to say i love chewy com  they are the absolutely the best company with whom i have ever dealt  my dogs have been eating this food for years and like it  however  i contacted chewy today because i am frustrated with receiving dented cans  this has been happening for about the past year  today  i opened a case and 11 out of the 12 cans are dented  some so much that i cannot stack them without them toppling  this is not normal  the outer and inner packaging are all completely intact  so why are the cans always dented  at what point will i feed my dogs what i think is food from an intact but dented can  only to find out that harmful bacteria has crept in  between this  the calcium
product	over half of the 24 cans delivered were dented to the point where i was concerned about the safety for my dog who has a compromised immune system
quality	my dogs would not eat this  i do not know why it came highly recommended by my dog walker who feeds it to his dog  it might be because it was grainfree   
quality	omg  my one pit smelled like cat urine   i couldn’t deal with the horrible smell that came off his fur  had to change his food and now he smells corn chip perfect again 
quality	i bought this for my most recent rescue with gi problems  he would not touch it so i tried mixing it in with my other 4 dogs dry food and they will not touch it and they are not picky eaters 
product	i liked feeding this to my dogs and they like eating it  it works just fine for my chihuahua and helped alot with my pit bulls sensitive skin  but my pitbulls poop would smell like death sooo bad and foul  not only that though it was also really dark and i felt like i could get a wiff coming from his skin  i read reviews about this happening with some other peoples dogs so i switched food and his poop went back to normal  worked for my chihuahua but not worth the horrid smell from my big dog 
health	i have a beagle basset mix who is more beagle than basset  i feel like we have beginning signs of allergies so tried this because its grain free  seems to like a little better than other but she is picky  also tried beef but she did not care for it either  i have been mixing with fruits or peanut butter so an entire bag does not gonto waste  i will try venison or bison next  i really want her to like this brand but we will see 
quality	we bought this for our dog and he would not touch it  it made his stool smell horrible and it was so dark  the first ingredient is sweet potato which means that is it is main ingredient  this food is not on the cheap side so it should have a protein listed first  we returned this after our dog starved himself for 3 days and bought d n  grain free and he is gobbling it up and doing so much better 
health	i have tried this food on two separate occasions  with the recommendation of my vet  after being on it for 8 days  my 2 dogs have gone back to scratching nonstop and looking miserable and uncomfortable  they each have several  hot spots  they did not have before  with one dog scratching until she bled  that is the only thing i have changed in their food  their  wet  food is homemade and fish based  after discovering that is the best way to keep their allergies under control  they are also on aller chlor  they were doing really well  i decided to add a dry food to help clean their teeth  back to the drawing board 
quality	my dog loved the chicken version  but i decided to try the sweet potato   fish because i heard fish keeps dogs cooler in the summer  my dog sniffed it and walked away uninterested  he will go a day or two without eating  i have had to get canned food to make him eat  i would still recommend it because the brand is so great  just make sure your dog likes it before getting a big bag    
quality	have not found anything in the  50  30lb price range that compares to taste of the wild  totw has lots more true meats  fruits and vegetables  many more flavors to choose from  my dogs would not eat this 
quality	my toy poodle likes these treats but they are too hard for his tiny mouth i wish that natural balance would come out with a soft treat
product	the food is very dry in the can  difficult to scoop out of the can and i’ve had this hill’s science diet for a long time but usually get it from petsmart and it was always soft and easy to serve  i’m wondering how this happens because it’s expensive and shouldn’t be like this   
quality	my dogs will not eat it even though my vet said they love it  wasted money  
product	the caliber of this i d stew compared to the same exact brand as my vet is night and day  chewy s has much more liquid and less substance than my vet s can  i will continue for one more delivery  if the cans are the same consistency as the first 2 cases  i will discontinue ordering and go to my vet for the food 
quality	my dog is super old and very picky  she did not like it and refused to eat it 
product	the cans are always crushed  so far i have lost 4 cans
product	i have had my shepherds on merrick for a long time and both have done great with the food  very disappointed that merrick lowered the size of the bag and still charging the same price  i’m equally disappointed at chewy for continuing with my auto ship without even mentioning the change in product  pretty sure i will go back to buying local 
product	i noticed the dog food has changed a few months ago but both dogs were eating it although not as quickly  my main complaint is the bag the dog food comes in  the bag is very flimsy so my last three shipments have come broken with dog food scattered in the bottom of the shipment box  this is a manufacturers issue and not chewy  i’m not sure why the manufacturer felt they needed to change the formula and bag but they really need to rethink that 
quality	all my dogs will turn away and refuse to eat this food  it was an expensive lesson  i tried passing it on to a friend who stated his dog refused it and would not eat his normal food when merrick s was added to the meal  he tossed it  i should have as well when the starlings did not touch it  do not waste your money 
quality	tried this one out as it had really good reviews but i found that they kibble is a lot larger in size than pictured and my dogs were not interested at all  bummer cause i loved that the ingredients all seemed healthy too  
quality	reading about this food sounds good  however my dogs will not eat it im looking for something elseim sure its good dog chow just not for me  thanks
quality	jaxie and maddie do not like this  i am not sure why  i am going to keep giving it to them and see if they will eventually eat it  otherwise  i am going to donate it to the shelter 
product	this is the worst dog food ever      my 3 dogs starved before they would eat this  way too much money for cardboard pellets   
health	too heavy on my dogs bellies i guess  switched them slowly from blue buffalo and all three ended up with sick stomachs 
quality	dog food is so hard  dogs would not eat at all  seems all this brand is really hard   my dogs would rather starve    would not recommend this item
product	very disappointed and dissatisfied  shipping took for ever  i had to buy a small bag of food anyways 
product	horrible dog food  expensive does not help and dog hates it  do not waste your money  tried everything to get my dog to eat it  even mixing the kibble with the expensive z d canned dog food 
quality	my dogs do not like this food  they would sniff at their bowls and walk away  i got them some non prescription food because i didn’t want them to starve 
health	what to begin    i have a older english bulldogge that was prescribed this diet which i did not agree with from the start  the ingredients are just horrible  well he actually did good on the hills science diet ultra z d until we bought the bag that said  new   improved  because they decided to make numerous changes  so my dog ended up at the vet after continuous scratching and a very large hot spot with mild ear infection and also some hair loss on his face  well my roommate decided to try the remainder of the bag for her dog  low and behold he now has a large hot spot  he is not a bulldog and is a mixed breed   the roommate s dog is 6 years old and has never experienced a hot spot and bouts of
health	my pup has food allergies and i have been feeding her royal canin hydrolyzed protein for a while now  and although she does well with that food  she has been itching a lot more recently  my vet suggested i try the hills prescription to see if that may work better  unfortunately…that was not the case  it did not settle well with my her tummy at all and gave her horrible gas     i think i will probably just stick with the royal canin for now  although the product did not work for me  the customer service was seriously outstanding  i called to return the item and there was no hassle whatsoever  i was off the phone with the friendly customer service rep in less then 5 minutes and the return was on
health	the product works for food allergies although the ingredients are awful but what choice do pets have with allergies 
health	this food has chicken as protien and supposedly its hydrolyzed so small it cannot cause allergic reaction  my dog had allergy testing and is allergic to chicken and tons of other ingredients in dog foods  i searched for a dry food and could not find a beef  fish  rabbit  or turkey dry food without other foods he cannot have in it  not even a dehydrated or raw food  so we are trying this food  it is expensive     my vet wanted more for it  so i order it here  just had to have chewy call my vet for prescription approval  my dog s allergies got so bad before allergy testing that he got a hemotoma on his left ear from head shaking and dirty ears  he hated the cone he wore while his ear drained 
quality	my dogs did not care for this food  they ate it after it sat in their dish for several days  i switched back to their old food 
quality	my dog did not care for this food  i bought 2 different flavors to see if he would prefer one over the other but to my surprise he did not care for either  he would leave it  if i did not have any purina to give him  i really think he would have starved himself  i am annoyed 
quality	one problem  my dogs do not like it  have put bone broth on it so they eat most of it  often leave some and this is not their normal eating habit 
product	my dog is the kind of dog who doesn’t leave food in her bowl  since we got this new food  she will leave food in her bowl all day without eating it  unless we add something tasty to it   i will not buy this brand again and will stick to what we normally feed her 
quality	my dog will not eat it  and now i have two bags of dog food that i basically have to throw in the trash 
quality	my dogs will not touch this dogfood  even my aussie who never misses a meal will not eat it  very disappointed 
quality	all 3 of my cocker spaniels do not like this food that much 
quality	my dog has never been a picky eater  that’s why i was surprised when he would not eat this food and thought maybe it was an upset stomach  my foster dog was not interested in this either  i know the brand has gotten good reviews for its nutritional value but for us it’s a fail 
quality	well sometimes they are happy to change sometimes they do not like it  food looks good and grains are not too big but what can we do
quality	my dog refused to eat it until i put a topper on it  his fur is beautiful and he does not itch  that is what matters because he hates all dog foods 
product	my 3 dachshunds do not really like this food  i am going to give it some time and see if they will start eating it  otherwise  very happy with chewy s service 
quality	i really wanted our bullmastiff to love this food after all the reviews  but he just does not care for it at all   i will be going back to the one his bulldog sister loves   royal canin bulldog  i think this one has good oil and must have more flavor i guess  the eukanuba seemed dry and lacked smell compared to the other 
product	the dogs like beneful  but it is expensive when you have four dogs  all large dogs 
product	i was disappointed when we received our first order to find out these are only 31 pound bags  i can only blame myself for not reading the description closely enuff but with two big dogs we will probably go back to buying the 40’s locally for the same price
product	first experience ordering from chewy and 2 bags of dog food had ants inside the packaging of the sealed food    never again  i will just take the trip to the stores  very disappointed in both beneful and chewy  this should not have happened 
quality	the price was better than buying 2 similar bags at the store  however  the top will not zip shut on this bag  so i have got 31 pounds of dog food in an bag that could tip over and spill all over the floor in my kitchen  also  i ordered the flavor that my dog likes the best   but he will not eat it unless he goes about three days with no food first  even i can see the difference in the color of the food  not sure if i am staying on the auto ship 
product	i received my order in a timely fashion at a good price  however  my purchase of dog food came with ants in the shipping box  i will not buy again 
quality	i have a very fussy dog and would not touch the food  i cannot say its terrible because of how he is  try for yourself 
quality	my dogs have always loved cesars  this one they refuse to eat 
quality	my pet does not like the new change  it claims to be the same great taste  my pet seems to disagree 
health	the service and delivery were great  but i think special foods that animals have to rely on for the rest of their lives should be a little more cheaper  with all that it in tales to maintain a sick animal already  i think the foods and the shots could be a little more affordable
health	do not buy this food for your diabetic if he needs to lose weight  i bought this food for months and had my dog on it  and nothing else due to being a diabetic and unable to have treats while getting his blood sugar under control  because my vet suggested it to help and not only did i still have issues with regulating my dogs blood sugar  but he did not lose one single lb in almost 3 months on this food  chewy did right and refunded one order for me  hills is supposed to have a 100  guarantee but they hide behind the fact that the animal consumed the food  which he was very picky about eating  i had to mix it with wet food to get him to eat it and sometimes even then he wouldnt finish all of
quality	our dog just does not like it and does not eat it     waste of money  our vet was out of samples  so we wasted big    on this 8 5 lb bag  <  however  our other chihuahua loves the i would low fat kibble for her pancreatitis  wish we could exchange the wd
quality	only food the  girls  have not devoured  therefore  the product may be good for them  but is it because they will not eat as much 
quality	i put my sheltie  harley  who is 6 on this food  he did not care for it  but the vet wanted him on it to lose weight  after the first bag was gone   he only lost one pound  30 lb  bag   i called hill s   explained this to them  the man that answered the telephone told me to  hang in there   he sent a couple of coupons to me that were expired when they got here  well  i hung in there with harley  but he never lost any weight   did not like the food at all  after three more bags of 17 lbs  i decided to give it up  we switched to merrick backcountry raw infusion pacific  this has salmon  whitefish  trout  cranberries  apple    blueberries in it  harley is much happier with this food  it
quality	my dogs are losing weight  but they will not eat it because it is to hard and they dislike the taste 
health	my dog gained so much weight on this food  we changed vets and he took our dog off this brand  in 3 weeks we have seen a 3 lb weight loss on the new diet
health	i ordered this for my two senior dogs  one needs to lose some weight and this food has less calories in it then the current brand i feed them  the one that needs to lose weight is fine with the food but my other dog refused to eat it and when he did he threw up the entire meal every time  it just did not work for him so he is back on the other dog food 
quality	just switched our 9 year old lab to this from the same formula that was not senior  mixed it half old with half new  only first week but so far she is not thrilled  purpose was for her to lose a litle weight so eating less will work  since large bag will not throw away  just wait and see  know it is good stuff but maybe she would like grain free better
product	i have still not seen my 20 00 refund on items being late  when the package was open there was dog food all n the box  a bag was sliced open and spilled all inside the box 
product	i ordered a different type of this product but that was not available when the order was due for delivery  i was surprised that the original order could not be correctly fulfilled since it was a standing order made well in advance  the representative i spoke with was quite polite and offered a substitute which i accepted  all went well with that  i have not yet begun to use that product but i am concerned about the possibility of weight gain  i appreciate the concept of your service since i am a senior with limited mobility and this is so convenient for me   my remarks are made in the spirit of assisting you to improve your service 
quality	i just switched our dogs to the blue buffalo for seniors    and am having to mix the select one with it   otherwise they will not eat the bb  our lab who eats anything    knew it was different and refused to eat it plain  i am hoping this is just because it is new to them     
quality	my dog did not like the taste at all shipping very convient  pricing a bit high  do not like auto ship  need to send out samples to your customers 
quality	my dogs did not like this at all  they would not eat it  i gave it to a animal rescue  i hope their dogs eat it 
quality	purina s pro plan  adult lamb and rice dog food was the only food both my dogs would eat that did not affect their stool and they both enjoyed  unfortunately  with my most recent autoship  i noticed that purina now was advertising the blend includes probiotics  i am unsure if the blend changed  or just the packaging itself but now both my dogs refuse to eat as much as they used to and seem disinterested when they finally do eat  it does not seem to mess with their stomachs  but they just do not like it as much and sometimes refuse to eat a meal altogether  however  i would still recommend it as it is one of the few foods that sit well with my animal s stomachs  when they finally eat it  and neither
product	i bought this for my girls because i was trying to save some money being that i have 4 dogs  bad decision  my girls fur is brittle and falling out  i’m on the second bag i bought wanting to give it a fair chance  after this i will go back to their previous food and soft shiny coats  saving money is not worth their health 
quality	bought this same exact dog food from other places she ate it no problem  she will not eat this food and i wish i knew why because of of the price  a great price on it very stumped  went and got a bag where i normally buy it and she eats it same identical brand  figure that one out 
health	great dog food  wish i could give it 5 stars but    with all my dogs allergies and because she is a senior this food works great as a topper to entice her to eat but the serving size is just to small  my dog is 100  pounds so i have to re supply often  by adding the option of a larger container size to accommodate larger dogs like mine would make it much more user friendly plus more earth friendly due to not throwing away so many small containers 
product	we’ve got three very different kinds of dogs  they don’t like this  our very food motivated springer spaniel will nibble it and walk away  that’s extremely rare  given that this food is on the expensive side  that is unacceptable 
quality	our dog did not like this food  would not touch it  also found out it is made in thailand  the meat is a wear texture
quality	i donated 98  of this  my shih tzu would not eat it  she hated it  it smells terrible too 
quality	for some reason my elderly chihuahua does not like this food and won’t eat it 
quality	low quality product  it gave my dog major runs  we will not be using this product again 
quality	just sucks  the dog would not eat at all   maybe a bad box  dont know
quality	in her old age  16  she is very finicky  hence i keep trying new brands as she will not eat the same food twice in a row  she would not eat this one at all 
quality	since the royal canine chihuahua was out of stock i had to try something  my dogs are very picky and several other things i have tried they would not eat  they ate enough to get by but were not thrilled  glad royal canine is back 
quality	good price  great ingredients but my dog will not eat it and she is not a picky eater
quality	they do not like this dog food they will not eat the brand that has real red meat in it either they will not eat any dry food that i have tried i need to find food for travel too  i love chewy com but have not found food that they will eat and i want real one hundred percent meat in it
quality	my basset hound does well on this kind of canned dog food  like most kids he does not eat the vegetables in this food or the potatoes but likes the meat 
quality	my dog never ate dog food in 18 years   did not eat this  
quality	i was very disappointed with this food  my dogs would not eat it 
quality	dogs did not eat it  i did not eat it but they do not seem to like it 
health	gave our dogs diarrhea  big time  even after 3 weeks  this food  although great for some dogs  is just too rich for our dixie and oscar  and because of that  we cannot recommend it  all we can recommend is that you try it and find out for youself  good luck  as for dixie and oscar  they are doing great on ultra 
quality	my dog ate this while it was being mixed over from her old food  but as soon as it went to just straight canidae she refused to eat  i left food in her bowl for two days and she would not touch it  i even began to hear her stomach growling  the food did not smell appealling at all  pros   nice  small kibble size   fair cost i switched her to another brand and she cleans her bowl now  i guess canidae just was not for her 
health	the puppy was being given canidae by the breeder  so we continued to feed her that  after 3 weeks  she still had loose stools  also  i felt that she did not love her food  what puppy does not instantly gobble up her breakfast in the morning  after switching to another brand  her stools are formed and she eagerly eats her food all day 
product	upon opening my 44 lb  bag of canidae als  i realized that most of the small kibble was crushed into even smaller pieces  i have ordered dog food through the mail before and never had this problem  so i have a hard time believing that this occurred while it was in route  also the hard dog treats that i ordered were not broke up that came in the same package  i will not be ordering my dogs food through mr  chewy in the future 
health	we are having to take our boy off our homemade diet which was grass fed 90  fat free angus beef   rice  sweet potato and various supplements due to allergies he has to stay on this and this only for one month to re evaluate  so far he has not really enjoyed the switch  even tho we transitioned him for two weeks   but so far his bm s are improving  the food smells horrid and i still can not understand how it has any food value being this processed but we will continue to see what develops  check back in a month 
health	i ordered a bag of rc veterinary diet ultamino dry dog food  the package was delivered and left on my front porch  the delivery person did not knock on the door or ring the door bell  i was home all day  the package was found by my husband when he arrived home from work  both the box and the package of dog food had been torn into by an outside dog  however  that dog  a large  mixed breed  did not eat the food  the dog the food was ordered for won’t eat it  either  i’ve offered it on three consecutive days  for 5 total offerings  she was clearly hungry at least three of the five times the food was offered  but refused it  she still wouldn’t eat it after giving her an appetite stimulant
health	we purchased this on the recommendation of our vet to see if it helps with our dog s ongoing skin allergies  so far  we have seen no difference in her itching and irritation  so for the price  it probably is not worth buying again  it smells like turmeric  so perhaps that is what is supposed to help with inflammation 
health	the food is good for my dog because he has allergies but it has a very strong smell
quality	my vet nutritionist prescribed this food for my dog because he stopped eating the other prescription diet for his ibd  but this he will not even approach  wish i did not fork out so much     for him to refuse it 
health	been buying hill s science diet for two years and our pup loved it  recently we noticed the size of the food pellet became smaller  right when we introduced the new pellet my dog began throwing up intermittently  unsure if the food ingredients changed or what the deal is  considering buying a new brand of dog food 
quality	ever since they changes their formula my dog will not eat it till she absolutely has to 
product	chewy s service is excellent  what very disappointing in this case is that the size of the nuggets was not clearly evidently and i ordered  or at least received the wrong size 
health	this used to be my the regular food that i fed to my german shepherd  for some reason with the last batch i received  he started having stomach issues and then just sniffing the food and looking at me because he didn’t want to eat it  he used to just gobble it up  i tried a different bag  and it didn’t help  i’m wondering if an ingredient might have changed  i know german shepherds can be ultra sensitive with their diet  so i’m going to be switching him to a different food  otherwise i didn’t have any issues with this food until recently  he’d been eating it for at least 6 months 
product	my 10 dogs like this food and eat every bite at feeding time  my most recent delivery  however  was not so great  the food in the bag looked like it had been run over by a tank  all crumbs 
quality	my dogs do not like this product  i will probably not be buying it again 
health	we have three dogs    two labs and a beagle mix  we mixed it with their old food  we put bacon in with it  cheese  etc  they actually pick out all the other bits out and leave this food  it has been two weeks    no  go  we tried switching because our vet thought that one of them had developed a food allergy  trying something else 
health	my 16 mo old female lab has been having major itching on her belly and feet  so my vet recommended this brand as a limited ingredient diet in the event she has food allergies  mealtime used to be a romping event of excitement with her previous food and now i have to beg and coax her to eat  she won’t eat the food in one sitting  she eats it over a period of time  makes me so sad   i don’t know if a different flavor would make her happier  
quality	lucy does not like it as well as the nutro brand  it is much more dry 
quality	jr likes it dry    if you put gravy or a liquid on it    he refuses to eat  switching to american journey  very nice that chewy has such top of the line pet foods 
quality	my dogs do not like this food  i thought they would like the venison for a change from salmon but i was wrong  i will try another formula of this same band 
quality	our dog absolutely refuses to eat this produce no matter how i try to dress it up 
health	we ordered this food because our usual autoship was out of stock  the 2 dogs have allergies  one to grain  one to chicken protein  this was a great replacement  they did not love it like they do the nutro food we usually get but ate it almost as well  we have bought other recipes prior to finding nutro venison and they much prefer the venison over the salmon of this brand 
product	originally used acana singles duck and pear  which both greyhounds ate well  but it was exorbitantly expensive for two large dogs  so i switched to natural balance duck and sweet potato  both dogs were happy with this  but as there were stocking issues we tried the venison  i have never seen the boy turn his nose up at food   he tries to eat poop  however i cannot get him to eat this  mixed it with yogurt  broth  canned food   he picks it out and leaves this  the girl seems to love it and has gained a few pounds sneaking his leftovers    however  as i have never seen him avoid food this definitely gets 2 stars 
health	this food did help my dog with his sensitive stomach and allergies  however  it has only a 20  protein content  which according to my vet is kind of low for most dogs and certainly too low for puppies  therefore  you may want to supplement this food with another protein  my dog does not love the taste  but he will eat it 
health	my star is not fair since 2 of my dogs loved the food but the one who has the severe food allergies broke out in a rash within hours of eating this food  i wish dog food companies had sample bags  i would be happy to pay for a sample bag so i can test which ones they like  hate and work on the food allergies   
quality	my dogs just smelled the bowl and walked away  they would not eat the first bite  several of these flavors have a strong smoke smell like when you use liquid smoke to cook with 
health	this item contains poultry fat and will set off chicken allergies  i have two dogs with varied levels of sensitivity to chicken products  and both began showing symptoms  otherwise  looks ok  small kibble and does not stink 
health	i ordered this food for my mom s dog who has been plagued with skin allergies in hopes that it would help clear up her skin  unfortunately she would not eat it at all so we will never know if it would ve worked 
health	love the product  my dogs don’t have anymore stomach issues  just curious  this is my 3rd order  is it normal for y’all to raise the price after someone gets started with you  i will now be looking for somewhere else to buy 
health	we switched the food of our 9 month old puppy to this product and she did not seem that interested in it like she did her previous food that we had started her on at 9 weeks old  i have now ordered her old food again and will see if it is the food or her appetite 
quality	one of my dogs started to refuse the food rhat i have been feeding for his whole life  i decided to try this based on a recommendation  sadly  the dog that was refusing to eat has passed  our remaining dog seems to suddenly really hate this food when we were just finishing the transirion  back we go to canidae 
health	this food constantly made my dog throw up  so i has to switch to blue  which made her much healthier  and happier 
quality	your 1 2 day delivery was actually more like 4 5 days   product was as advertised nothing special   my dog does not care for it and i probably will have to order something different
health	after introducing this food into my dog s diet  she got sick  going back to chicken 
product	none of my dogs cared for this food  i tried for weeks and finally gave up  returned the food for refund 
quality	our dog loved this food  there was a marked increase in energy and her coat looked awesome  the negative part was that her stools became very soft runny and she was having bowel movements 5 to 6 times a day  we switched her to another nature recipe food and all systems are back to normal 
health	adopted 2 little rescues within 4 months  had trouble transitioning them to the same food then one got terrible diarrhea  vet suggested limited ingredient and i liked what i had read from others so i tried bascis  they didn’t seem to care for the turkey but they hated the little life source pieces and would pick through the bowl and spit them out on the floor  they ate only one of their meals per day  probably because they were very hungry  i want them to enjoy their food so i switched to a limited ingredient brand without the life source bits  they weren’t on basics long enough to go through a lengthy transition and they now enjoy mealtime  it would be a better idea to have a choice of formulas
quality	my dogs will not touch this food  i was very shocked  they love the wet trays  so i figured the dry would be a hit  nope  not one bite  they both refuse to even taste it  go figure  total waste of money 
quality	i used to feed my dog blue buffalo basics sensitive solution grain free turkey and potato  bb has apparently changed formulas and packaging design and is now calling it blue buffalo basics limited ingredient grain free formula turkey   potato  the ingredients are not the same  only after my poor dog was having major gas and itchy skin did i think to sit down and compare the ingredients on the labels  there is a slew of new stuff and a fair amount of other ingredients that are left out  also  as of 5 27 14  the ingredients listed here on chewy are those of the old formula  double check with blue buffalo s website for the updated ingredient list 
quality	my dog is not a picky eater and he would not touch it  i had to donate it
health	is not eating this unless i add something like no sodium chicken stock  it does seem to be nutritious though  he is growing at a heathly weight  no diarrhea  and his skin and coat look nice  i will continue with this food but i highly doubt i will buy from chewy again  maybe i am just slow but why pay 50  with autoship  when i can buy it locally for 43  i just think it is silly for chewy to charge shipping for customers using autoship  but that is just my opinion 
health	always satisfied with everything we purchase  but i was expecting this food to be the small bites for puppies  we lost a puppy once because he choked on the larger size bites  i will not be using this food 
quality	this product has been on auto ship for the last year  last bag smelled awful like fish food  my dog would not eat  threw it away
health	my dog chokes and coughs out his puppy food  i need a bigger dog food chunks for puppies
quality	my two yorkies are not eating it  the last bag i bought was a small one at cub  they finished so fast  that i felt confident to order a big bag from you guys  but they do not like this one  i do not understand why  they smelled and walk away 
product	love this dog food  my dog enjoys it  the packaging is really pretty and the food seems to be enjoyable 
quality	my do do not like food i have to add something to eat so she will eat it
quality	i bought this for my blue heeler puppy and she will not eat it  my vet gave me a sample of a different name brand and she gives it right up  will not be ordering again 
health	i have fed my cats blue buffalo food and figured i would give my puppy the blue buffalo puppy food as well  he loves the food and always wants more  however the food does not like him back  he had bad blowout diarrhea for a couple days  i tried to figure out if it was treats  something he got into or his food  by process of elimination i figured it was the food  i switched him to a different brand and the diarrhea stopped within 24hrs  i do not know what is in the food that made him so sick but my vet told me i am not the only one who has had issues with blue buffalo puppy food 
health	i was transitioning my puppy from royal canin to blue buffalo about the 5th day  i had to take him to the vet  he had a bad rash  diarrhea and gas  i had to give benadryl and add some probiotics to his food  needless to say i switched him back to royal canin  dr  orders   blue buffalo has a lot of bad reviews  i will never feed it to my dog again  i just threw away  50 00 
quality	i will not by it again  two of my dogs are seniors and 1 does not have teeth  even after an hour of soaking the food in hot water she cannot eat it because it is still so hard  even my 3 year old is having to work to chew it  i am going to put my babies back on purina one and never change again 
quality	unsure if bc it is a new food or what  but my dog does not eat it very fast  but she does eventually eat it  meaning that in the am she will not finish her 1 1 2 cups right away  but will sometime throughout the day 
product	big dogs loved it but my chi s did not   which was disappointing cause it is good quality at an affordable price compared to what i usually buy that is good quality but a bit more costly for less food even 
quality	nice clean product  my dogs will not touch it  if you have a non picky  food motivated dog it is a great value with a great tag  nice sized pieces for dogs of all sizes and ages  we donated it to the humane society  they are always happy to see us coming    
quality	i have reservations because one of the 1st 4 ingredients is chicken by product meal  that literally could be any throw away parts of the chicken 
quality	buddy so far does not like this as well as his other food  we still have a lot left and i will keep feeding him this for awhile 
product	this is way to expensive and so far it has not worked on reducing my dogs gas 
health	i had previously ordered purina diet for digestive issues  changed to hills diet because they had smaller kibble as dog is miniature schnauzer however she pretty much stopped eating with the new kibble and now is back to the purina
health	my gsd was recently diagnosed with epi  bacterial intestinal infection  and b12 deficiency  this product is working well as we work to get weight back on him  that he lost during the diagnosis process 
quality	this product was a bad choice on my part  i bought a cheap product and that is what i got  my dog does not like it but will eat it if i dress it up  add gravy  48 pound bag    that is alot of gravy   
quality	my dogs usually eat anything but they do not like this food at all  
quality	most of my dogs loved the new food  but my big girl  over 100 lbs   who is usually the chow hound decided she did not like the food for some reason  she has never refused food before  but does not like the beef chow   i have to pour chicken broth over it to get her to eat it 
quality	as a farmer i am very unhappy with the marketing tactics nutro has went to   1 is jumping on the non gmo band wagon and  2 is all the pasture fed ingredients  every time i see a company jump on this bandwagon of taking advantage of uninformed consumers fears to sell their product it makes me not want to buy it  i also do not like the new design of the bags  since all the lamb dog food has went to this pasture fed stuff  the large breed and the adult dog food look almost the exact same  our supplier has made the mistake of accidentally buying the wrong product and also my son has accidentally picked up the wrong bag because of their similarity in looks  i also do not like this new formula  you ve
health	my bloodhound  who will eat most anything  will not touch it  blue buffalo is not what it used to be  chewy offers great service  b
quality	i guess i have a picky eater stopped eating natural choice natural balance and does not like blue buffalo  do not know what to do   vet checked and all is well  he is active for a 10 yr old puggle 
product	my dog is allergic to chicken  so i need something with no chicken products in it  online i guess all the ingredients are not listed  this dog food and the other rachel ray dogfood both have chicken by products  i was disappointed 
quality	my senior black lab hated this food  but he likes the rachel ray zero grain  not sure why  but he allows the just 6 to sit in his bowl for days    now  i have a half of the largest bag of this dog food that i will have to throw away    a waste of money 
health	i believe other dogs may like the lamb  my dogs were sick even when we had put chicken in with it  its ok  some just cannot get it  i still take the chicken dog food of rachel rays  they all love it 
quality	ingredients are good for them  but they simply will not eat it  first time for everything  normally they are not so picky 
quality	my dogs were eating iam s lamb dry dog food but chewy ran out of it for my next order so i had to pick a new one  my dogs do not like this food  they think it is boring and do not even want to touch it 
product	i got for a golden doodle   but she won’t touch it   another friends says she mixed it s rr chicken veg for “ perfect mix “ forvher golden doodle but mind hates it   the chicken veg she likes ok but not as much as the blue i’ve been buying for years for other dogs   my pack is 4 dogs   so i won’t be buying again i’d say make sure your dog likes salmon or fishy type food as for me i’m sure when i call chewy they’ll let me donate it and refund this part  this is a great company   i did that a few years ago bc that’s the kind of co they are   truly they care
quality	the description of this food on the bag does not say “grain free” however written on the bottom of the bag it says  “no corn  wheat or soy”  this is grain free  i’m glad i noticed this beofre i opened the bag  our usual natural balance was discontined  and the chewy rep suggested this for a replacement  as it didn’t say “grain free”  i would have as well as  again  those words are not in the main description  our dog has heart issues and cannot have grain free at all  luckily  chewy gave us a refund and now we re in a search for a new food 
quality	will not buy again  poor quality ingredients  food came broken and dried out  very little oil  and quite a lot of powderized product in the bag  any food made with any type of meat  meal  as the main source of protein should be avoided 
quality	my dog loved other flavor of taste of wild  however  he turned his nose up the wetlands  purchased another grain free to blend  he is still not pleased  but will eventually eat with a 70  blend of another flavor 
quality	my dog usually gets orijen but lately i have tried some of the other brands  this one he will not touch  tried mixing in a little at a time  covering with meat drippings from our dinner and still he walks away  sorry but we will not get anymore of this 
quality	i have 2 gsds  the male is a finicky eater and the female will eat anything  i gave the food a 3 star only because he would not eat it  but she did  i will try something else  i hate to try other food even though i am getting the discount  fromm was a hit 
health	although this product improved my dogs coat and skin allergies from other pet foods  my lab does not like it much  when it is feeding time he now looks at me like i just yelled at him when seeing this product in his dish  it is very expensive 
product	everything looks good on the packaging but my dog tried this product once and she has never eaten this again 
quality	i bought a big bag and my dogs will not eat it  mixed in small amounts with their old food and they picked around the new food  not sure why  but both will just not eat it   i will donate the food  hopefully it will not go to waste  next time i will try a small bag first    
quality	well i bought a large bag and my dogs would not touch it  mixed small amounts in with their old food  and they still would not eat it  my suggestion would be to buy the smallest bag to try it out 
quality	our dogs have never really taken to this food  they let it sit around and lazily ate it but never seemed very interested  they finally gave up the ghost this past week   we had two full days of them refusing to eat any of the food  out of desperation and because we were traveling  we vacation in an rv  we stopped at a convenience store and picked up a  4 bag of purina dog chow  they both eat the dog chow  not sure if we just got a bad lot or if they’d just had enough because we have gone through a couple of bags of this food 
product	when i opened the bag delivered from chewy  i noticed the kibbles have inconsistent colors  the regular store bought core has uniform color  also the packaging is different  there is no self sealing strips  is it because chewy s core products are special bulk products  one of my dogs do not seem to like this despite she did not have any issues with the store bought core 
health	my dog developed allergies to eggs  corn  and alfalfa  this food meets the criteria but he does not like it  i have to chase him around the kitchen and hand feed him  i like the ingredients but the dog apparently does not 
health	we switched to this because orijen was no longer being carried by chewy  our lab has been having diarrhea off and on since we started the switch in late july  it is been over 3 weeks now  vet thinks it is due to the protein source 
health	i have a 1 year old australian shepherd you has a very sensitive stomach  it’s been very difficult to find dry food and dog treats that his stomach can handle  i recently switched him from merrick grain free puppy recipe to wellness core  i slowly weened him off his old food and now he is 100  on wellness core  ever since the switch he has had horrible diarrhea about 3 5 times a day  wellness core seems to be a very good product based on reviews  however  it was not good for us  we will be trying wellness limited ingredients – salmon and potato recipe 
health	probably a good product  but it is a bit too runny for my senior guy   it looks like his allergies are acting up  i really wanted to try it because it is better priced than is prescription meds  but i guess i will have to try something else 
quality	i hate that i try to order something healthy for her ans she will not eat it 
product	nothing wrong with the food itself   but some of the cans arrived badly dented   i really dislike dented cans as i’m very uneasy about feeding them to my babies   is it even safe to use them   i wish quality control was better  
quality	while i have always had good success with chewy com  i was disappointed in these cans of dog food  out of 12 cans  4 of them were dented and unusable  that is a third of my order  not pleased  these cans were not dented in shipment  they were cans that were on the inside of the packaging towards the center of the 12 pack 
quality	i cannot really give something a bad review just because my pup does not like it  but i seem to have found the one food he will not inhale  he actually gives it a look like it has an evil spirit dwelling within  he will eat a few bites  step away  look at the dish  hesitate  and then go back  i finally had to say  ok enough he does not like it 
quality	i will not be buying this again  because my dog does not like it  i am sure it is a good product  and very good for my diabetic dog  but science diet makes a similar product that is more like a chicken stew  it has chunks of chicken and visible vegetables  she likes this much more  and that is what i will give her 
quality	this stuff is nasty  the texture is like wallpaper paste and our dog will not eat it  i tried holding food but had to feed him something else to control the insulin levels 
health	tried to return this originally but didn’t have box or time to go through return process so decided to give it a try because we needed puppy food  normally i enjoy bb brands but disappointed in the size of the pellets  on left is bb and right is eukanuba  both large breed puppy foods  the life bits are so small they aren’t even chewable  tried to transition because i like their ingredients better than most pet foods  i’d have to say the regular adult sized food is same size as large breed puppy  could be okay for young pups but my 2 month old aussie rottie mixed basically swallows it whole and doesn’t seem to enjoy it much  i followed the transition guide and it still made him sick as well  he
quality	i have a purebred german shepherd he never had any problems with the pro plan puppy food loves the taste of blue buffalo but very soft to runny stool since eating it for two weeks going back to purina  
health	the only thing is  brown rice is hard to digest  dogs with sensitive stomachs could possibly have problems 
product	i would normally give this product 5 stars however it arrived in a bag that was ripped open in the box that it came in  the box was fine  so the issue lies with the packer  i was very disappointed  i have however purchased this item before in the store and think the product itself is a healthy choice for my pup and he loves it 
product	my puppies been raised on this product since it was able to eat dry food i have been feeding them it for a month and he is not really wanting it all the time he will eat it when he it is necessary so i am still skeptical but i am going to continue to use it and see where it goes i am just going to add some water to it
health	had my boxer puppy on this from day 1   kept having intermittent bouts of diarrhea  straight liquid   followed with some soft stool  i also noticed he had insatiable thirst  no uti  no worms  blood work normal   checked multiple times on varying occasions  as this went on  his coat started to thin and he developed patches of hair loss    at this point i stopped cold turkey  switched to homemade chicken and rice  literally as soon as i stopped feeding this  his problems resolved  aside from the hair that is still growing back   i slowly introduced a different kibble  and he is currently on full feeds with the new one with the thirst gone  and diarrhea gone  i should have known something was up
product	if there was a zero  that’s what i would give for this order  the buffalo blue freedom senior bag had moths in it with what appeared to be larva worms and the adult buffalo blue no grain had clumps of food in the bag  i was so disappointed  all the other times the orders were great  but this causes me to stop ordering dry food from you  i will go to petsmart and get it  they will honor your price  just sooo disappointed  
quality	do not buy this food for your dog  it will just sit in the bowl as you wistfully think of what else you could have done with the money you spent on it  although my dog is picky he would not even eat it out of my hand as kibble  my daughters dog who will eat anything sniffed at it and walked away  although nutritionally this brand gets very high reviews that will not do you any good if your dog will not even taste it  it must have something to do with the way it smells because as other reviewers have remarked  it does not pass the  sniff test  
health	i recently tried to switch slowly from wellness core to wellness complete due to the possible issues with  grain free  diets  my dogs allergies flared up as well as gi signs  we are going back to wellness core 
health	my dogs seemed to enjoy this food but it gave them awful diarrhea  will not buy again 
quality	all 3 of my dogs did not like this food  even my lab that always eats anything would not eat this food  i will be donating to our shel 
product	quick service and delivery       wish my dog liked the food better 
quality	she will not eat it  i have added to it with food she likes  i think it is the large nuggets  i am sure it is great food but my doberman just will not eat it  now i have a whole large bag wasted 
health	unfortunately my dog did not do well with this  i am not aware of any food allergies she may have  but she never adjusted to it  she did love the taste  though 
health	i used to highly recommend this formula  as it was the only one that i had found that my german shepherd  hannah  could eat  any other food would make her so itchy that she would chew hot spots all over herself that would ooze  she would also develop horrible ear infections that made her ears ooze and smell awful  i had her on this formula for months  and then they changed it  i have since put her on the taste of the wild pacific stream  and she is doing much better  i am also disappointed that chewy offered the dog food at a great price   10 cheaper per bag  so i bought in bulk   and then when it was time to order more  the price is the same  and sometimes higher than my local feed store
quality	my puppies will not eat this food  we have tried everything  they simply smell it and walk away completely uninterested  huge waste of money since we have opened the bag
quality	this is really good  healthy food so i bought it for my new cavalier king charles spaniel  he is not fond of the taste so he has to be extra hungry to eat it  i mix it with wet food and he does good with that  will try something different now 
quality	i do not like the downsizing of the packaging  a full two pounds lighter than my last order  yes  i am still paying the same price  but really not  since i will have to order sooner  two pounds is a lot 
quality	i was really excited when i received this food and was hoping my dogs would like it but alas they did not  i put some in the food bowls and they sniffed it took a bite and spit it out  i left it a while and they kept going back to their bowls but just were not interested  i do not have picky eaters or need special foods for dietary restrictions but trial and error right 
product	my dog did not like it   it was a waste of money    so i do not think i am buying this ever again
health	make sure to check with your vet before switching to this food    my dog had been vomiting and having accidents in his crate and the house after systematically switching to this food  the vet advised grain free is very hard to digest and that it can cause heart issues  so make sure this is the best choice for your dog  as it wasn’t for mine 
health	had high expectations for this product  however  after trying a few bags my puppy still has diarrhea  thought it was just a bad batch   took my puppy to vet a few times  after a lot of tests there’s no other choice but to change food 
health	i am a huge taste of the wild fan love the food but beings i have a puppy i tried this and oh my did she get sick and barley ate it   i felt so bad for her    so i will be sticking with only the adult food  
quality	our puppy ended up with the horrible runs and wont eat this brand  actually spits it out of her mouth  that is how bad she does not like it  hoping it is just a texture thing because it does have great ingredients in it 
quality	my 8week old puppy refuses to eat it  highly upset because this was not cheap 
product	recieved my order very fast  no damage and order was correct  very disappointed in the food  puppy wont eat it  i even tried a little chicken broth on it and still wont eat it  now i guess i have to pitch it  what a waste of  50   chewy com is great i will continue to shop with them  i do not reccomend this food
quality	my seven year old bull terrier loved this food when he was a puppy  now i have a 6 month old rhodesian ridgeback so i thought i would get the same type  he refuses to eat it  i will put the food down and he will sit there and just look at me because he wants food  i mixed some of his previous puppy food in with this one and he will pick out his old food and leave this behind  he is basically starving himself and will only eat if he absolutely cannot take it any longer  i am not sure what has changed with this food but there is a huge difference from what it used to be  i put a little bit in front of my bull terrier and he would not eat it either  and he eats absolutely everything 
quality	should have started with a smaller bag   our pup ate this very reluctantly at first when it was mixed with his other food  and then stopped eating it all together once it was fed alone  we have recently switched to another food that he is happier with and is doing fine on  ingredients look great and it is a very highly recommended food  possibly just too rich for our puppy  we were given a refund and customer service is great so that is also a plus 
product	slightly disappointed with package  bags were intact but box was full of earwigs 
quality	almost the same as earthborn  but does not get as good a rating from the independent company  taste of the wild used to have a 4   5 star rating  but that has recently dropped to 3   4 star  i tried this once  but my dogs would not eat it 
health	this food was prescribed by vet for my gsds urinary tract problems and crystals in urine  my poor girl isn’t wild about it and she loves to eat  it’s a shame a more flavorful food isn’t available
quality	while i will do everything i can for my pup  this particular food seems bland and unappealing  my dog sometimes refuses to eat it and will wait until she is very hungry 
health	i liked that the bag came shrinked  it all apeared to be in reasonable shape  but my dog does not like the taste an refuses to eat  only eats some if starve him for a day or two  the smell comparing it with any  other dog food is not at all reasonable to me an my dog  my dog always is wanting food and has a good appetite  hes more tolerant of the canned food  but the vet prefers he eats the dry food 
product	i bought this product because my dog will be on it for life and it is cheaper than feeding her the canned dog food  i have no problem getting her to eat the canned food but she is reluctant to eat the dry  i have to add a little chicken broth to her food to get her to eat it  just wish this was made to taste a better because it is less expensive in the long run than canned food  i buy both dried and canned and switch them out to give her a variety 
product	i was very surprised   disappointed in this grain free food  the first ingredient is beef  but then peas  pea meal    by products  our dogs refused it  very disappointing even at the bogo price 
product	you had a buy one get one free offer but when i placed the order it showed up as 25  off first order only  such a disappointment 
quality	we decided to try this  based on a buy one get one free deal  since my dog was looking for a little variety in his dry food  but my dog is small   23 pounds   and the deal was two 40 pound bags  he does not hate this food  but he does not love it  either  we donated the extra bag to our local shelter  because he does not like it that much  so it was not really a great deal  i would not buy this again  free bag or not 
quality	this dog food was the worse my dogs is not that picky but mine would not touch it  i had to give it away  the price was great and reviws was pretty good and maybe for some dogs but mine would not touch it at all
quality	normally i get my dogs american journey but i have 5 large dogs and the largest bag  22lbs  is literally gone in just a couple days  tru acre had a bogo sale of their 40 lbs bags so i thought it would be a great buy  none of my dogs like it  they all turn their nose up to it and sit here with growling bellies  so now i have 70  lbs of dog food left that my dogs refuse to eat  it is a shame that it is so hard to find large quantities of good quality food  that my dogs enjoy  at a price that is affordable 
health	i have really only found one reasonably priced food my dog can have because of his allergies  we’ve been using taste of the wild  he has such bad allergies he’s even allergic to himself  the buy one get one free was definitely a plus but my pups really don’t care for it much  i’ll end up going back to the taste of the wild and donate the other bags to my local humane society  little bummed it didn’t work out for my guys 
quality	saw this quality brand on sale recently here at chewy and took a chance  i eased it into rotation with my purina savor and my 2 border collies turned their nose up at it  they will only eat it if i crack an egg over it or add something to it  going to be slow going getting rid of 2 big sacks of this stuff   it does seem like good food though    so   3 stars 
product	bought 2 bags of this and mixed one part of true acre with 3 parts old food  then 50 50  both dogs pick out old food from true acres if i put just true acres  they wont touch it  it has similar ingredients of old food  diamond  i am very disappointed
health	i purchased this because my dog has multiple food allergies  we never even made the switch  just a quarter cup in with her regular kibble gave her explosive diarrhea 
product	i have 3 dogs and none of them would eat this food  i was very disappointed 
health	lots of toots  but they are liking this food  so far we have had no whole food throw up or excessive eating of grass  didn’t help the licking so far  fingers crossed
quality	i wanted to switch to a different food since the food i have been buying changed their ingredients  my dogs ate the first bag but i had to add stuff to it just so they would eat it but their stool was really runny  i bought a 2nd bag and they just wont touch the food so i am back on my old and my poochies are happy
quality	tried this brand in 2 different flavors to give my dog a change and some variety  but  he would not eat it  even tried mixing it with other foods and rice  etc   which he normally loves  he ate the other stuff and left the food or spit it out  guess he just did not like this one  back to his regular purina one  i cannot say its not a good food  it just was not to his taste 
quality	but i do not think it agrees with our puppies  one of the pups just picks at her bowl   the other eats like he is starving  however both are having runny stools 
quality	my puppy hates this food  with all the super duper ingredients in it  what good does it do if she does not eat it 
quality	my dogs would have nothing to do with this  lost 10 lbs because of it   my dog would not eat this and after i put it in the container i store the food in    now they will not eat the food i put in that container  i had to dispose of that also    
product	my 78 pound gsd mix did not really like this food plus she throws up every time she ate it so not the best but the ingredients are not awful so that is one plus and you can get this food basically anywhere  anyway  the shipping was fast and free so that was great 
health	my dog who has never had issues with a sensitive stomach before  threw up twice because of this food  she is a mastiff and we do t let her run around after she eats and never gets table scraps  looking for a new food for her 
quality	i know that iams makes great products but my 1 yr old cane corso does not care for this puppy food  she eats just about anything but she is slow to eat this  she has to be really hungry to eat it  will need to switch her off this brand flavor  i do not blame iams 
product	the product states 38 5 lbs on the bag  however the shipping box plus the bag of food only weighed 37 0 lbs  disappointed that iams would short their bags  i wont buy iams again 
quality	delivery was excellent as always    but dog did not touch this at all  we are donating the food to a shelter  we just have a picky eater 
quality	my dogs did not like this food  i do not know if it is the texture of the food or the taste  they are great danes and i thought i would put this on top of their food  they did not care for it 
quality	my dogs would not eat it  drys out to fast  if dogs do not eat it as soon as you dish it up  it drys out and you have to throw it away 
product	am i the only customer whose puppy is having a poop problem with this food   yes my pembroke corgi puppy looks great and got great reviews from our vet on her checkup but she poops about 15 times a day and the stool is not firm  also she eats it but does not gobble it up like she loves it  it is more a eat all day long to get a little bowl eaten  the poop is so frustrating because seems like i am constantly cleaning up behind her and i thought this would be good for that since it is chicken and rice 
product	i am very happy with this dog food  my 5 month old puppy happily gobbles his food without hesitation  i did have a problem with the delivery  my whole order which was approximately over 70lbs was left in the middle of my driveway instead of being put on my front porch  if i had wanted to carry the items myself i would have gone to my local pet store and physically bought it  not only that but anyone could have taken the items 
quality	3rd and 4th ingredients  chicken by product meal  corn gluten meal  my puppy ate this food for the first 13 weeks of her life  but we have since switched to orijen  which does not have any animal by products and is full of high quality meat and veggies  my puppy never turned her nose up at the pro plan kibble  but when we were switching over and i gave her a mix of the two foods she would pick out all of the orijen kibble to eat and leave the pp in the bowl 
quality	although the food seemed fine  ms  lilly would not eat it  so my neighbors little dogs like them just fine
quality	he will not eat this product  i tried putting chicken broth on it and adding pieces of chicken  he picks the chicken out of it 
quality	then turned their noses up i can’t find anything that holds their interest
quality	he would not eat it at first  then he did just once  it was too soft  and the next day he had loose bowels  i thought it would have been more chunky  he always liked the turkey  any feedback from the higher pups on that hills turkey diet 
product	this is supposed to be a good quality dog food  so why does it have all this jelly crap in it  i will never buy blue buffalo canned dog food except maybe the weight management one  the natural choice is far and beyond a better dog food 
health	i have a 7 pound pomeranian and i think this food was just too much or too rich for her  she would eat it but it made her very sick for about a week and a half  i am donating 11 out of the 12 cans i ordered but with a disclaimer that it may cause diarrhea   i believe that the food is high quality but maybe it is just not appropriate for the smaller dog breeds  subsequently  i did a google search and it does not look like i am the first one that had issues with this brand 
product	my dog loved these from the start  however  i recently opened the package to give her one  exp is 7 16 20  and discovered white and blue fuzzy mold all over them  i was shocked  i happened to have another sealed package  which i opened  and discovered it was soooo much darker in color than the first bag ever had been  i am reading reviews about mold concerns  so i am not sure what is going on with these  but it is definitely concerning 
quality	looked good when received but when opened found very dry and brittle piece s inside  when i gave one to my dog she refused to eat it 
product	the chicken is so thin and such small pieces that i probably will not buy again  i was hoping for larger portions 
product	so disappointed for the price of this product i received nothing but broken bits i would have liked the product if there were more too it  smelled good the texture looked like it was good but i won’t be ordering this again
product	contents of bag stated 8 oz but my bag was 4 oz of jerky and 4 oz of flakes that were basically dust after waiting an extra week for the delivery  i found this new product not worth the money  even at buy 1 get 1 free 
product	my dogs love this products  what i do not love is that the slices are so thin 2 of my 3 packages were delivered to me in crumbs  i would not get them again  it ended up as just being sprinkled on their food 
product	my dog loved this but the majority of the bag was in tiny broken pieces  impossible to give without pouring it on the floor or in a bowl  pass 
product	my dogs like the treats  the only thing that i believe needs to be changed is the packaging or the packing  the treats are very thin and  as such  they were broken into little pieces by the time i received it  the pieces were too small to give to my larger dogs 
quality	chose this brand to see if my bernese would stop scratching and chewing on her legs  i was feeding a brand that had freeze dried raw sprayed on each piece and i was afraid that was making her itch  she did stop but unless i top this food with chicken pieces or other cooked food she would not eat it 
quality	my vet recommended switching to this brand but my dog does not like it   looking for another option
health	we have a lab shepherd mix who is allergic to what seems like everything  we got this food after trying multiple options prior  it helped with his allergies but it did not take too long for him to refuse to eat it  i tried to mix it with the matching wet food but he still would barely touch it  now i am currently trying to get rid of the bag of this food by mixing a little bit with the new food each time he eat  overall a good food for dogs with allergies but unfortunately the taste must not be that great 
health	i am not saying his dog food is not a good food i am just saying that i tried it spent 50 some dollars for a bag and my dog had an allergic outbreak and he has allergies anyway so i had to spend more money to find something else
health	it made my dogs constipated and one of them developed diarrhea  will not buy it again 
quality	i have fed victor professional formula for several years  had been pleased for the most part  but noticed while coats were shiney they were not full  recently my dogs refused to eat victor professional  new formula is inferior to the old formula  ingredient quality is not as good and calories per cup went down from 440 to 400 calories and recommended serving size went up so i now have to serve more food at an increased price  i no longer recommend victor and have changed foods 
health	i have several dogs  i’ve had my dogs on science diet and iams thru the years but due to recent dietary upsets i decided to switch foods  unsure if they have changed formulas recently but my dogs stopped eating it and we’re getting diarrhea  i was able to switch foods easily with no diarrhea issues like we had with iams and science diet  no gas problems either with this food  they don’t love the food but they’ll eat it  one dog doesn’t like it at all  i have to add something on the food to get them to eat it  going to try the multi pro next time  has a little more grain and less protein  maybe they will like that  over all not bad  ingredients seem good  but i see now victor is changing formulas
product	no matter how long i feed victor i keep getting bags that my dogs won’t touch  i was told before that they are a small batch and they can vary  but i can no longer justify paying for this expensive food and having to add toppers to get them to eat 
health	my dog has been on this for a while  and has never had an issue until now  recently he has had diarrhea  an upset stomach  and his coat is not nearly as shiny and healthy  i was told victor changed their recipe recently  which is definitely not agreeing with my dog 
quality	we have 5 dogs they all seem to like this food and do okay on it except for our english mastiff  he would not eat this food  we are trying a different brand 
product	granted  i am not a scientist  but when i opened the treat bag  it smelled just like his kibble  i checked the ingredients of both  between the two  there are only five ingredients that are in one but not the other  and none of these ingredients are things one could buy in a supermarket  with the exception of sodium sulfate  i can barely pronounce these ingredients  note  the amounts of some ingredients seem to differ between the kibble and the treats  so that may make a difference in taste  but the treats are much more expensive  neither am i a mathematician  but my math says the treats cost 40 cents per ounce  whereas the kibble costs 2 cents  the good news is my dog likes his kibble  in the
product	my dogs snob this food and will not even eat it  what a waste of money 
health	i did not taste it so it is hard to review it  my dog ate it  and continues to eat it  she has not fallen over or gotten sick from it
quality	i have almost always bought purina one  but do not like the canned kind  there is a lot of gel looking substance that goes through my dogs and comes in their stool the same  what is this gel  and what is it for  
product	5 out of the 6 cans arrived badly dented  the product is well liked by my dog  but i was unhappy with the condition in which it arrived 
product	this item arrived with every can dented and leaking  i could barely stand the smell inside the box  i had to throw every can away  i will never order this online again 
quality	roxie will not eat this variety  however  she does like the purina beyond grain free variety 
quality	i cannot review this product as i do not eat it and refuse to taste it  my dog eats it so i guess he likes it 
quality	my dogs both hated this food and refused to eat it  i ended up giving it away 
health	i bought this because chewy is currently out of my regular food  my dog needs gluten free  grain free fish based food due to allergies  the ingredients in this food fit the bill but it smells so bad  incredibly fishy  my dogs hate it 
health	i have one dog that has major allergies  and he liked it  i was not sure about the salmon mix because i had tried another brand that they both hated  but i had already purchased this online  my dog with the allergies liked it and ate it just fine  but my pit did not like it at all  but i think she just does not like salmon  she turned her nose up to the other food too  i will try this again until my pupper will not eat it any more 
quality	i ordered 2 bags when they were buy 1 get 1 and my oeb will not eat it  i wanted him to like it but he went from finishing his food to barely touching it  i am not sure if it is the salmon or the brand but we had to swith both for him to eat  we donated the extra food to a rescue so at least some lucky dog will have quality food 
quality	i switched my two huskies and havanese from blue buffalo danali food to this and they want nothing to do with this food  they starved themselves for 3 days and still would not touch it  i just had to go buy some canned food with gravy to mix in with it to make them eat it  it is a great price  i had high hopes for it  they just do not care for it 
quality	i had been feeding american journey grain free chicken and sweet potato  not the limited ingredient  and they loved that one  figured i would give this one a try  they do not like it  and the pieces of food are larger then the other type  all 4 of my yorkies are 7 pounds and under 
quality	i loved the price and the ingredients list on this food  unfortunately  my dogs hated it and will not eat it 
health	i recently had to switch my dogs food to no chicken  our dog has skin allergies and we wanted to see if the cause could be chicken  this food say red meat but after receiving it saw lots of chicken meal etc   in the ingredients  i bought two huge bags     
product	my babies do not really like this food and i am having to make gravy and add meat to it just to disguise the dog food so they will eat what i purchased 
health	we picked blue buffalo because they seemed to have better ingredients  since putting my dog on this food he has had diarrhea on a consistent basis  we have tried two different brands of blue  this being the second  but nothing has changed  we have even tried their wet canned food with no luck 
quality	hi  i bought blue buffalo for a large dog  my dog weighs in at over 65 lbs  he does not like it  i was surprised since everyone who has a dog and buys that brand say their dogs like it  it is a bit bigger than the origin brand that he is used to  i now have 22 lbs of blue buffalo that will probably go to the humane society  c  lenk
quality	i feed my lab diet rotation between merrick  orijen and i was trying blue buffalo  but my lab just did not love it  while this is supposed to be a high end grain free dog food  you can see it it is not the quality that merrick and orijen both of which continually get 5 stars  also  i am concerned about after blue buffalo admitted they use by products in their food if this food was of the quality i would expect 
quality	i am sure this is probably a great product  but my three sniffed and walked away  could have been the salmon flavor  i tried mixing with boiled chicken and nope  they walked away  so i gave the case of food to my neighbor  again  my three are picky and sooiled 
product	i was very disappointed to find out that there is sugar in this  it really blows my mind  i should have read the ingredients before i bought it  but i thought with it being grain free it would have good ingredients 
quality	i was hoping my dog  with her sensitive tummy  would like this food   but she barely touches it    i give her rice and she eats the rice  and has no tummy problems   but she cannot eat rice all the time  unless there is something new with rice that she would like 
quality	my picky lab did not like this canned food  the texture is quite dry and he just would not eat it even when mixed with the dry food he likes  my daughters mastiff mix did eat it however 
health	i have two dogs  one of which has been diagnosed with pancreatitis  the other has a sensitive stomach  my sensitive stomach dog will not touch this particular type of food  but she is very hard to please with just about anything  my pancreatitis dog eats it  but reluctantly  they both do much better with the turkey or chicken stew prescription brands 
quality	my dog would not even go near her bowl when i poured it in  she normally loves wet food so this was a shocker  she legit would not come within 2 feet of this lol  customer service was amazing   they gave us a full refund in return for us sending the remainder to a pet shelter which we did immediately 
product	several cans arrived dented  next time i will buy in person at petsmart or vet s office 
quality	my dogs will not eat this food  i am going to donate to shelter 
quality	i bought these for my saint bernard hound mix when our vet recommended switching to hydrolyzed treats  he loves treats and will usually eat just about any of kind of treats you give him  but he will not even take these purina treats from me when i try to give him one  i now have a whole bag of treats he will not eat 
quality	she eats them but first she turns her nose up at them and only eats them once she realizes she is not getting anything else 
product	when we opened the package a lot of the treats were broken into little pieces  i would not buy again 
quality	i ordered these thinking my picky terrier would like them  but they really do not have a scent and he is all about scent  so he just walked away and left it on the floor  what dog does that  mine      
quality	my two shih tzus refused to eat any of the dog food items in this variety pack of canned dog food   and i cannot blame them as each of the medleys included in this variety pack smelled nasty even to me 
quality	they say it is a topper or a meal my dog does not like it is not particularly fond of it good luck
quality	i was not happy with this dog food  i was trying to find a grain free formula that my two german shepherds would both eat  neither of them would eat this  i was very surprised that they turned their noses up at this food  i really do not know why 
health	while this dog food has good ingredients  my two dogs do not care for it much  my older jack russel terrier is especially sensitive to some foods  and this one especially so  it seems to upset his stomach and he vomited after eating it twice  while this may be a good food for some dogs  it is not good for mine  i was disappointed that it was not to their liking so will not buy this food again 
health	have used this product for at least a year  love the product  however it is my first time ordering it from chewy com and i am disappointed about how unfresh it seemed  when i bought it from the place i used to purchase it from  the food seemed very fresh  greasy  and even smelled fresh  when purchased from chewy com the smell is gone  food was dry  and the kibble actually seems to curl it was so dry  maybe the bag was old or somehow stored in incorrect temperatures  not sure if i will order it again from this company or not  have not decided yet  as far as food goes  it is a great quality food  it is the only food i can feed my french mastiff due to his food allergies 
quality	cannot say i will get this again as my dogs do not like it 
quality	i thought this dry dog food would make a good topping for my dogs regular dog food  she does not like it so i have to give it 1 star 
quality	decided to try this because it was less expensive  thought it would be a good alternative  but our 2 little dogs do not care for it  when i put it in their bowl  they just sniff and walk away  usually they will go back to the bowl later and eat a few pieces  they did not care for pedigree either  we may have to go back to cesars 
quality	i am fostering an abused dog  showing her such love and safe structure as i can and have been unable to find anything she will eat  i have been hand feeding her hamburger  chicken  scrambled eggs  this is a first for me in 40 years of living with dogs  i tried this food and she smelled it and walked away  i tried taking it away and then giving it to her 4 times over 2 days  her decision was always the same  no thanks  i know my dogs in the past would have been wagging their tails hip to hip over this  but trixie lefay just said  nope ~not even  no thanks   just an emphatic  nope   she appears to be a prima donna   sigh  thank you for trying chewy   i did find a wet food through chewy that
quality	my dogs did not like the food  chunks were too hard 
product	dogs didn’t enjoy it as much as the rise and shine  great package size  this was the steak flavor 
quality	my dogs wont eat it  they all turned their noses up to it  i will now have to donate a  60 bag of dog food and buy something else 
health	i think my pup has an allergy to this food  he is scratching his ears and anal gland seems to be irradiated 
quality	analytically and protein source based this should be the preferred kibble for any dog  but my entire pack  6 dogs  refused to eat it  we gave it to the spca 
quality	per the ingredients  this is some quality stuff for any dog  but for my 50 lb  pit mix  it is just not tasty enough  he eats a little bit  then starts snacking  walking away with a little in his mouth and returning when he feels like it  he never commits to just eating the food  i have added chicken and scrambled eggs  i tried a little moisture so the food would have sort of a gravy but he will not eat it  idk what else to say
quality	my 10lb terrier mix picks out the small round pieces of food in this  he leaves the right next to the bowl  he refuses to eat them  going to try something else  other than that issue  he likes this food 
product	there are two types of kibbles   brown and black ones  our dog simply hates the black kibbles and this is spread all over the floor as she selectively eats only the brown kibbles  i will not buy it again 
quality	our pups are not fans of this food  at all  even with dressing it up with homemade soup  or meat and veggies  or pancakes and syrup  my mastiff  would eat it  but only with sauce  no dryness  but he is not too hard to please  however  my picky pitties  would not touch this at all  they would eat the extra added yummies  even going as far as to suck the soups off the pieces and spit them out  seriously  if your pups have taste buds  i would not recommend purchasing this food for them    it may not be eaten at all  which sucks since it seems to be very healthy on paper  but its like a sugar free  gluten free  taste free protein bar 
health	recently my dog has allergies to chicken  my dog smells this food and walks away she never had a problem eating anything this food looks like dry dog food in a can 
health	i was kind of weirded out when i dished out a full size vitamin capsule out of the can  i was a little leery of feeding this to my boy  so far he hasn’t gotten sick but he really doesn’t like it very much  not sure if it’s the flavor or something else  i will just need to keep an eye on it 
quality	our 2 eat it but i can tell they do not like it too well  they are not cleaning their bowl 
product	my bischon seemed to like it the first couple times she had it  but refused it out of 4 different cans  i do not know if it was a bad batch or she just decided it was too bland  for her to refuse wet food at all is really out of the norm
quality	i buy the duck flavor regularly and my dogs do not like this one i’m not sure why
health	harper and i have been fighting food allergies along with environmental ones for 4 5 months now  we were on an veterinarian diet that i think was making things worse  i was talked into buying this food at a local pet shop  i am not hip that it is grain free  i was told since it was a higher protein than what harper was on to add pumpkin  well poor harper is convinced i am starving her  she gobbles it  1 4c with a teaspoon of pumpkin  down morning and night  it seems like for eating roughly a 1 2c of kibble a day  she is pooping 1c  her poop is normal otherwise  she does seem to be asking to go out a few extra times per day  but at least she is not guzzling water and choking herself  her itchy 
health	i have 1 dog with allergies  normally at least 2 of the 3 will like what the other doesn t  all 3 of my dogs missed meals when i put this in their bowls  i was hoping this would have had better results  not worth almost  70 a bag 
quality	since our mastiff  breed that is not known to be finicky  had been having some tummy trouble we thought a different food would help  she flat out refused to eat this  we started by mixing it with her old food  but she literally ate her old kibble piece by piece and left this food in the bowl  we tried coating it in yogurt and pumpkin  her 2 fav foods  and she still refused to eat  trying a different brand now 
quality	my dog who has never been picky about flavors thus far  did not care for this one  we have tried the lamb and turkey and he loved those  he will eat it but without the gusto he normally has 
quality	at first i thought i hit a winner between the price and it had more veges than fresh pet  snickers ate it one day  the second day he was not interested  his dinner sat for a few hours before he would touch it  now he just flat out refused to eat it 
quality	this started out great  my dog loved it  i would switch between the flavors to make sure she got different protein  she liked it for maybe 4 months and then decided she did not like it anymore and refused to eat it  not sure why  it was pretty simple to make  wish my dog liked it still 
health	my dog liked the first bag they sent  the second bag he refused to eat  the beef blend gave him diarrhea  will not be buying this again 
product	my dog eats anything and everything but after picking out the broccoli spinach and peas  you are left with a very pricey ground chicken  maybe yours will like it 
quality	i am sure this product is fine but my 14 year old pup did not take to it at all  i followed the guide lines for feeding but he would not touch it  he would actually eat around it 
quality	tried on the advice of chewy rep  our old girl turns her nose up to everything but slim jim s    and we were desperate  i emailed chewy and they suggested this  she turned her nose to it  i warmed it  still nothing  added chicken gravy  nope  nothing  the search continues  it looks like a quality product  shipped quickly and in great shape  just not for us  
quality	i have a papillion  i thought tylee s would be the best compared to other brands which would be great so i can do one  stop purchasing by adding it to auto ship ect  my sweetie however would not touch it from day one  i used the guide for food transitioning included  confirmed the method with his vet  and still nothing  though i immediately put it in the freezer right when it got delivered  thawed as stated    i think my dog would agree when i say that it not like others  it does not look like sliced meat  the smell of chicken was not present  nor the typical smell you expect from vegetables  i truly thought that how it pictured was accurate and i am disappointed  now i have 2 bags of dog food that
product	i really wanted my dogs to love this food  like chow down  love it  unfortunately  they don t  they just like it or tolerate it   looks healthy  i love that you can see the natural mix ins  convenient that you can just defrost what you need  packaging is great  arrived frozen as it should be  my dogs will not just eat this food on it is own  need to mix in some canned food to get them to eat  perhaps it is just the chicken flavor but i cannot afford to keep buying different flavors to see  so i guess i am still searching for that perfect  chow down  healthy food 
quality	my older dog just refused to eat this  and i even warmed it up for him  the other guy did eat it but far preferred the beef flavor  i only use this food as a topper   with a 65lb and 50lb dog this is far too expensive to use as a main food 
quality	this is probably a better dog food than some out there since it is human grade  but after reading the questions and finding out it is not gmo free  i have decided to switch to organic  at first  our shih tzu loved the chicken and then all of a sudden she totally refused to eat it  it does have a strange smell 
quality	i have 3 dogs  and none of them would eat this  unfortunately i bought 2 bags  i do not even like the smell  i followed the instructions  but the dogs would not eat it 
product	i loved the product and so did my dog  but the packaging was so combersome that i do not want to order it again  it came in a gigantic  heavy box that completely filled my trash can  all for just a small bag of food  i realize they need to keep it frozen  so the dry ice makes sense  but sadly i am more environmentally conscious than that and the waste of shipping container outweighs the benefit of the product  sorry 
quality	my picky girl hates the chicken but loves the beef  do not know why  but when she gets the beef  she cleans her plate  she will not touch the chicken 
quality	i had high hopes for this food and ingredients seem good but my dog really did not care for it  i tried to use as a topper on her dry food but still had to add other foods to get her to eat her kibble 
product	very disappointed in this product  i ordered 2 large bags of this product  the first bag was fine   i was able to distinguish what each item was  peas  meat  etc   the second bag was nothing but ground dust and when i say dust   i mean dust  i could not pick out a pea or anything  it looked like a full bag of frozen ground dust  i cancelled my autoship of this product and will not be feeding it to my dogs anymore  chewy was great as item came when they said it would and packaging was really well done as this food was a refrigerated item 
quality	at first he ate it and i thought he liked it but after 2 times of giving it to him he just would not eat it  i have a lot left and my dog will not touch it 
quality	i do not have a picky dog  she has eaten everything i’ve ever put in her bowl but unfortunately she would not eat this tylees dog food  super surprised she won’t eat it  as i’ve heard great things about it
quality	my dog did not like this  he sniffed it and walked away and would not touch it  i bought this hoping i could transition him from my own home made human grade recipe  chicken  brown rice  peas and carrots  to this  i was willing to pay the extra money so i did not have to meal prep every week  but bear did not seem to be interested 
product	my dogs liked it but went bad way to fast ended up throwing away about half the bag on each sort of adisappointment
quality	puppy did not like this food  i tried to mix it with the puppy s food and she still would not eat it 
quality	my dog picks out each meat nugget and loves them  she will not eat the vegetables therefore making a huge mess around her dinner bowl with all of the pieces she has refused 
quality	three of my dogs would not touch this food  two of them are kind of picky eaters  so i was not surprised by that  but my boy will eat just about anything and he does not even like this food  i was expecting whole food that is easily identified  but this food seems processed  to me it smells like cardboard  i tried heating it  mixing it with broth and they still would not eat it 
quality	i ordered this by mistake  intending to order the chicken stew variety  i have tried everything i can think of to persuade my fluffy to eat this stuff  but he just is not having it  and the other dogs will not eat it either  the texture is just kind of weird  like very solid jello  and none of the dogs like it  he is not too crazy about any of the k d products  but this one is just not happening for him  i hate to post negative reviews  but nobody here likes this food 
health	working for my 15 year old maltese  used to throw up after she ate not anymore      
quality	loves the dry would not eat the caned    it is almost unknown for a healthy dog not to eat what it needs  unfortunately  in too many cases  it is less than the package says  and less than the owner thinks the dog should have  many dogs are quite good at holding out for tastier chow  like kids  sometimes it calls for tough love 
health	so our dog now requires a renal diet and our vet recommended two options  hill s being one of them  both of them are big companies that have the resources to publish studies verifying their renal diet s validity  which doctors tend to require for recommendations  but both have unhealthy ingredients  like meat by products and corn   this one even has sugar in it  i wish one of the companies that make high quality dog food would make a renal food  i tried dave s but our dog did not like it  and the vet said it was not backed by scientific studies     
health	if there was an option for no stars  i would use it  this is pork liver with the consistency of gelatin  it is gross to look at and my dog must think it is gross too bc he will not eat it  do yourself a huge favor and do not subject your sick pup to spending the rest of his days eating this processed garbage 
product	we purchased a 12 pack of the hills kd canned food along with a bag of the dry food at the recommendation of our vet  our dog is 16 and is showing some early signs of kidney complications  we tried mixing the kd food in with her regular dog food   that did not work   we tried feeding her the kd food on its own   that did not work either  we finally got her to eat some of the kd food by mixing it with hamburger and rice  hopefully we can back out the hamburger and rice as time goes by  small samples of these expensive prescription dog foods should be made available to the customer so we can sample different brands and find one that the dog will eat thus benefiting from the special diet 
health	hello  i decided to try this brand for my dog with allergies and i wanted few ingredients  i received it on saturday  i started on sunday to slowly introducing it to my dogs diet  he started throwing up on tuesday  i will not feed this to him again  very disappointed 
product	my dog does great on the kangaroo but started chewing her feet and scratching on the lamb  i guess it is back to the more expensive kangaroo formula 
quality	not sure if it was zignature food brand or if was the flavor  but my furbabies did not care for it 
quality	good food but one of my huskies will not eat it  going back to fromm s  less poop with fromms
health	i am not sure what no fillers means exactly but i was expecting a food with only salmon as the protein  the second ingredient is chicken meal  therefore i cannot feed my dog with allergies this food  i wasted 42  
product	he likes taste  but  trying to figure out what food is best is a nightmare  no grain   grain  no chicken meal  no peas  no potatoes  etc  decided to try a less expensive brand until i figure this out 
quality	my 9 month old german shepherd puppy does not like this expensive dog food  specifically for gsd puppies  i am going back to pro plan  what a waste of money 
product	have to add stuff to his bowl  he really doesn’t like it  i have a lot of waste  sad because this food is very expensive 
quality	new german shepherd puppy will not eat food  sniffs and walks away completely uninterested
health	no more loose stools  thank you royal canin for the wonderful product 
quality	my dog has been eating this brand for a while now and she loved it  now she will not even go near it  when i bought the bag  i thought that the design on the bag only changed  i opened it up and found the food looked different and the nuggets are flat and not round  now i have to change dog food and that is not good for any dog  chicken soup dog brand really messed up with change   why change something that was good   
quality	i have tried everything to make my dog like this because it seems so healthy   fresh meat  salmon topping  you name it    she just refuses to eat it   for days at a time  unfortunately i just received another auto shipment  but i clearly need to look at the return policy  i guess this is when mail order is not so convenient 
product	will not buy again  way to much milo  a cheap filler
product	will not buy again  too much dust and fine particles  seeds were tiny  continually clogged up bird feeder  because when it got wet from rain it hardened solid 
product	we love chewy and place several orders a month during the winter when we feed a lot of wildlife  this is the first bag of kaytee products i have ever purchase that i was disappointed in  it contained a fairly large number of stones  pebbles and pieces of twig in addition to the edible seeds and was very powdery  which left a mess in the mudroom where i load up the feeders  i have not seen that in a bag of bird food before  we will go back to our old brand as chewy does have the best prices on the food for the birds and squirrels 
quality	economical  but my birds did not eat as quickly as other selections  i now remember why i did not care for this brand  it contains morning glory seeds  which produce many vines with very tiny small white flowers  so need to constantly weed around the feeder 
product	prefer the pennington classic i used to buy and wish it was offered by chewy since delivery is a plus but this pours out with lots of dust so will not purchase again 
product	once all that is left is milo seed birds disappears  would not buy again  a lot of waste
quality	birds do not eat it  i have placed it in several locations  squirrels do not eat it either 
product	i bought this because i thought it would have a higher percentage of sunflower seeds than the smaller seeds  it did not  that’s frustrating not only because the birds like sunflower seeds better  but also because my bird feeders work better with those bigger seeds in the mix  won’t be purchasing this again 
product	this seed is a disappointment and puzzling  my birds do not seem to like it and are just shoveling it on the ground  i ordered 5 bags of this stuff to mix with my black oil sunflower seeds thinking it would make my whole feathery crew happy  my cardinals have stopped coming which is another part of the puzzle because i know they love sunflower seeds  anyway  frustrating  not sure what mix i can make that will bring back my pairs of cardinals    plus  the pigeons in my area love this seed which i do not consider a plus  at any rate  not sure what to do but will continue my efforts to find a solution 
product	i’m a long time birder  this seed was basically worthless  mostly cheap uneaten seed pushed to the ground  a waste of money  poorly shipped 
product	the picture of the product from chewy is not very accurate to the actual product in such the ratio of the various seeds is very misleading  it shows a higher concentration of sunflower seeds and corn than the actual products contains  overall  extremely disappointing and very dissatisfied 
product	i won’t get it again i was looking for more of a variety and less of the little stuff  i was disappointed because the picture looks like there’s more of a variety 
quality	mistake on two parts  i did not realize this was such a big bag when i added it to our auto ship  and months later  i still have half the bag left because the birds will not eat it  i decided to use it for the feeder the farthest from the house and three weeks later  the feeder was still half full  as soon as it snows i am tipping it all in the back woods 
product	i was disappointed when opened this  the picture on the ad has more selections and what i received was 95  millets  5  sunflower seeds and 5  grains 
quality	so many fillers  the birds around here refuse to eat the milo  it’s just sitting all over my porch  the white millet shells make a mess but at least they’re being eaten  going to switch to something pricier  without the milo 
quality	still in feeders and on the ground     even the squirrels are not interested
quality	very disappointed in the quality of this seed  mostly red millet which birds do not like so it ends up on the ground  very small amounts of sunflower seeds
quality	i purchase this because it is economical  however  my finches  society and zebra  leave a lot of the seeds behind  there are some bigger seeds in this mix that they will not eat and are wasted  so even though it is cheaper it may not be the right choice for finches 
quality	i do not think i will buy this bird food again my parakeets just threw the food around and i had a mess  maybe they need to get use to this bird food but the bigger seed they did not eat 
quality	our cockatiel did not care for this treat  we will not purchase it again 
product	not even close to what i thought i was buying  does not even seems like real food ingredients  will not buy again 
quality	my bird is not eating this  can i get a refund and my money back please 
product	my african grey did not really like this product  rarely ate it
